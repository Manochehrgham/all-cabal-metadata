description: ! 'Speaks the Erlang network protocol and impersonates an Erlang node

  on the network.  Fully capable of bi-directional communication with

  Erlang.  Erlang types are, as far as reasonable, mapped to Haskell

  types.  Messages to Erlang are just function calls in Haskell, and

  messages from Erlang are delivered to MVars.'

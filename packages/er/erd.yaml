description: ! 'erd transforms a plain text description of a relational database schema
  to a

  graphical representation of that schema. It is intended that the graph make

  use of common conventions when depicting entity-relationship diagrams,

  including modeling the cardinality of relationships between entities.


  A quick example that transforms an `er` file to a PDF:


  > $ curl ''https://raw.github.com/BurntSushi/erd/master/examples/simple.er'' > simple.er

  > $ cat simple.er

  > # Entities are declared in ''['' ... '']''. All attributes after the entity header

  > # up until the end of the file (or the next entity declaration) correspond

  > # to this entity.

  > [Person]

  > *name

  > height

  > weight

  > +birth_location_id

  >

  > [Location]

  > *id

  > city

  > state

  > country

  >

  > # Each relationship must be between exactly two entities, which need not

  > # be distinct. Each entity in the relationship has exactly one of four

  > # possible cardinalities:

  > #

  > # Cardinality    Syntax

  > # 0 or 1         0

  > # exactly 1      1

  > # 0 or more      *

  > # 1 or more      +

  > Person *--1 Location

  > $ erd -i simple.er -o simple.pdf


  The PDF should now contain a graph that looks like this:

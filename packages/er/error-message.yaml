description: ! 'This philosophy behind this package is that it is often better to
  find

  out all of the errors that have occured in a computation and report them

  simultaneously, rather than aborting as soon as the first error is

  encountered.  Towards this end, this module supplies a type of

  /combinable error messages/ so that all of the errors from subcomputations

  can be gathered and presented together.


  New in version 1.1:  Removed Monoid instance for Doc (it should now be supplied
  by ansi-wl-pprint), added ErrorMessageOr type alias.'

description: ! 'A contention-free STM hash map for Haskell.


  "Contention-free" means that the map will never cause spurious conflicts.

  A transaction operating on the map will only ever have to retry if

  another transaction is operating on the same key at the same time.


  This is an implementation of the *transactional trie*,

  which is basically a *lock-free concurrent hash trie* lifted into STM.

  For a detailed discussion, including an evaluation of its performance,

  see Chapter 4 of [my master''s thesis](https://github.com/mcschroeder/thesis).

description: ! 'A contention-free STM hash map.

  \"Contention-free\" means that the map will never cause spurious conflicts.

  A transaction operating on the map will only ever have to retry if

  another transaction is operating on the same key at the same time.


  This is an implementation of the /transactional trie/,

  which is basically a /lock-free concurrent hash trie/ lifted into STM.

  For a detailed discussion, including an evaluation of its performance,

  see Chapter 4 of <https://github.com/mcschroeder/thesis my master''s thesis>.'

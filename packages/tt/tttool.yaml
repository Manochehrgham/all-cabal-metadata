description: ! "Das tttool hat jetzt eine deutsche Webseite für Anwender: http://tttool.entropia.de/\n\ntip-toi-reveng\n==============\n\n\nThe
  goal of this project is to understand the file and paper format for the\nRavensburger
  TipToi pen. The ultimate goal is that everyone can create their\nown books, with
  their own sounds.\n\nThe current status is that we understood most of the file format
  (see the\n[GME file format specification](GME-Format.md)). We provide a tool that
  allows\nyou to dissect these files.\n\nThe tool can also be used to generate completely
  new files from scratch; see\nbelow for details.\n\nIf you want to learn more please
  have a look into our wiki (https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng/wiki).\n\nThe
  tttool tool\n---------------\n\nUse the tool `tttool` to investigate the gme files
  and build new ones. It\nsupports various subcommands:\n\n    GME creation commands:\n
  \   assemble                 creates a gme file from the given source\n\n    OID
  code creation commands:\n\n    oid-table                creates a PDF file with
  all codes in the yaml file\n    oid-codes                creates PNG files for every
  OID in the yaml file.\n    oid-code                 creates PNG files for each given
  code(s)\n\n    GME analysis commands:\n    info                     Print general
  information about a GME file\n    export                   dumps the file in the
  human-readable yaml format\n    scripts                  prints the decoded scripts
  for each OID\n    script                   prints the decoded scripts for a specific
  OID\n    games                    prints the decoded games\n    lint                     checks
  for errors in the file or in this program\n    segments                 lists all
  known parts of the file, with description.\n    segment                  prints
  the decoded scripts for a specific OID\n    explain                  print a hexdump
  of a GME file with descriptions\n    holes                    lists all unknown
  parts of the file.\n    rewrite                  parses the file and reads it again
  (for debugging)\n\n    GME extraction commands:\n    media                    dumps
  all audio samples\n    binaries                 dumps all binaries\n\n    Simulation
  commands:\n    play                     interactively play a GME file\n\nRun\n\n
  \   ./tttool --help\n\nto learn about global options (e.g. DPI settings), and\n\n
  \   ./tttool command --help\n\nfor the options of the individual command.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis
  program is written in Haskell and can be installed on Windows, MacOS or Linux.\n\nFor
  Windows users, we create zipfile containing `tttool`, you can find them in\nthe
  [releases section](https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng/releases) of\nthe
  github project.\n\nOtherwise, installation from source is not difficult either:\n\n
  1. If you have not done so yet, fetch the source code and change to the\n    directory
  containing the code:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng.git
  tttool\n        cd tttool\n\n 2. Install the *Haskell platform*, see http://www.haskell.org/platform/\n
  \   for details for your system. Users of Debian or Ubuntu simply run\n\n        apt-get
  install haskell-platform\n\n 3. Install the development packages for ncurses, i.e.\n\n
  \       apt-get install libncurses5-dev\n\n 4. Install the Haskell dependencies.
  The Haskell platform comes with a tool\n    called `cabal`, and you should run the
  two commands\n\n        cabal update\n        cabal install --only-dependencies\n\n
  5. Now you can build the program using\n\n        cabal install --bindir=.\n\n 6.
  At this point, `tttool` should be ready to go. If you run\n\n        ./tttool\n\n
  \   you should see the list of commands shown above.\n\nIf you have any problems,
  you can [report an issue via GitHub](https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng/issues).\n\nBuilding
  your own gme files\n---------------------------\n\nOnce you have installed `tttool`,
  you can create your own `.gme` files. The\nprocess is as follows\n\n 1. Record the
  audio samples you want to include, as Ogg Vorbis files, mono, 22050Hz. I use\n\n
  \       arecord -r 22050 foo.wav\n        oggenc foo.wav\n        rm foo.wav\n\n
  2. Write a `my-book.yaml` file containing some general information, and especially\n
  \   the scripts (i.e. what to do) for each OIDs (i.e. the various fields of a\n
  \   book). You can use the [example.yaml](example.yaml) file as a starting\n    point;
  it contains more information in its comments.\n\n 3. Run `./tttool assemble my-book.yaml`,
  and make sure it reports no error, i.e.\n    finishes silently.\n\n 4. Copy the
  now generated `my-book.gme` to your TipToi pen and enjoy!\n\nIf you need to find
  out what OID code corresponds to what part of the book, you\ncan generate a debug
  gme using the `debug.yaml` file, adjusting its\n`Product-Id` to your product’s id,
  building it with `./tttool assemble\ndebug.yaml` and loading the resulting `debug.gme`
  on your pen.  It will then\nread out the codes, as a sequence of english digits.\n\nWe
  are also collecting template files, where the OIDs are commented; these can\nbe
  found in the `./templates` directory. Please improve and contribute!\n\nAgain, please
  let us know if you have problems, but also tell us what fun\nthings you did if you
  succeded.\n\nText to speech\n--------------\n\nIf you have `libttspico-utils` and
  `vorbis-tools installed`, you can have tttool\ngenerate audio files from text for
  you, which makes developing your yaml file\nmuch easier. See [text2speech.yaml](text2speech.yaml)
  for more information.\n\nPrinting your own books\n-----------------------\n\nWith
  the code in this repository, you can create GME files. This is even more\nfun if
  you can also create your own books! „Pronwan“ found out how that works,\nas you
  can see in [this video demonstration](http://youtu.be/KC97F4PfNhk). He\nalso published
  30 minute [video tutorial](http://youtu.be/4AjvjFM8GzM) (in\nGerman).\n\nPress Review\n------------\n\n

  video\n\nTODO\n----\n\n * What are all the header fields? (See [wip/Header.md](wip/Header.md))\n
  * Finish decoding the games. (See [wip/games.txt](wip/games.txt))\n * What is the
  purpose of the additional script table?\n\nOther resources in this repository\n----------------------------------\n\n
  * [`oid-decoder.html`](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng/blob/master/oid-decoder.html)
  allows you to manually decode an OID image.\n * `scripts/updates.sh` downloads all
  gme files from the Ravensburger server.\n * `gameanalyse.c` and `libtiptoi.c` is
  an alternative tool to investigate gme\n   files. It can also [replace audio files
  in gme files](Audio/README.md);\n   compile and run it for diagnostic output.\n
  * `Audio/` contains some audio files, such as digits read out.\n * `docs/` collects
  information about TipToi found elsewhere.\n * `matlab/` contains scripts to analyse
  gme files in Matlab\n * `wip/` (work in progess) contains notes about the parts
  of the gme files that are not\n   fully understood yet.\n * `perl-tools` contains
  a perl based script, to generate a PDF with all OID codes from a yaml-file as well
  some functions to generate PNG-files, inject pHYs-chunks with resolution hints into
  GD generated PNG files as result from some testing\n\n"

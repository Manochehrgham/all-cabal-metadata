synopsis: Utility functions for processing MIDI files
changelog: ! "## v0.2\n\n  * added `TimeSig` type and associated functions, so time
  signatures\n    in a `MeasureMap` remember their denominators\n    instead of e.g.
  converting 6/8 to 3/4\n\n  * `unmakeTempoMap`, `unmakeMeasureMap`\n\n  * relicensed
  as BSD3\n\n  * note: the only change that necessitated a major version bump\n    was
  the removal of the `Ord` instance for `TempoMap` and `MeasureMap`\n\n## v0.1.1.1\n\n
  \ * fixed a bug in \"extractFirst\" (the time value returned was incorrect)\n\n##
  v0.1.1\n\n  * added `Eq`/`Ord`/`Show` instances to `TempoMap` and `MeasureMap`\n\n
  \ * `TempoMap` can go back to an event list of tempos,\n    and `MeasureMap` can
  go back to an event list of time signatures\n\n## v0.1\n\n  * initial release\n"

  * Use tempos to translate between musical time (beats) and real time (seconds).


  * Use time signatures to reference positions using measures instead of just beats.


  * Find or change the names of MIDI tracks.'

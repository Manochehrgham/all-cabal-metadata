description: ! 'Lenses satisfy the properties of the Category type class, and are
  used

  to inspect and update individual elements of a data structue in a type-safe

  way. This library provides the simplest possible data types satisfying

  these properties.

  "minilens" type aims to provide a very simple improvement on Haskell''s

  record syntax: the idea of composable record accessors called ''Lens''es.

  As of yet, there are no fancy Template Haskell APIs for generating lenses

  programmatically; you are expected to write your lenses by hand. Some handy

  helper functions are provided to help you do this.

  This library was originally part of the Dao package, but has been branched

  into it''s own package in the hopes that it will be useful in a wider

  variety of projects.'

description: ! 'Bindings to Miniball, a C++ library (<http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gaertner/miniball.html>)
  for

  computing the smallest enclosing ball of a set of points in Euclidean space.


  The Miniball library itself is not included, as I consider it a dependency. It consists
  of only

  a header file, and can be retrieved from <http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/gaertner/miniball.html>.

  To build this package, simply have @miniball.hpp@ in GCC''s include path. The standard
  C++ library

  and GCC with C++ support are also needed.


  Hackage probably fails to build the Haddock documentation since Miniball itself
  is missing. The

  documentation can be viewed at <http://nonempty.org/software/haskell-miniball/>.


  Miniball itself is copyright 1999-2013, Bernd GÃ¤rtner.


  The current version has only been tested with version 3.0 of Miniball.


  Changes in version 0.1.0.2:


  * Improve allocation before FFI call. Good speedup for short calls (factor 3 for
  100000 points in R^3).'

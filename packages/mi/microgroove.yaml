description: ! '# microgroove

  Microgroove supports type-safe positional heterogeneous records similar to [vinyl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vinyl-0.6.0/docs/Data-Vinyl-Core.html#t:Rec)
  and [SOP](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop-0.3.1.0/docs/Generics-SOP.html#t:NP).

  Unlike these record types which are represented by linked lists, `microgroove`''s
  `Rec` type is backed by arrays, and so support constant-time indexing and mutable
  updates via the associated `MRec` type.


  Microgroove can be used for lightweight statically specified polymorphic records
  just like `vinyl`, but also dynamic record types that are only provided at run-time,
  such as receiving an arbitrary JSON protocol.


  # build

  The recommended way to build microgroove is via [stack](https://www.haskellstack.org)
  with `stack build`


  # contribute

  microgroove is an early alpha, so please submit any bugs or feature requests on

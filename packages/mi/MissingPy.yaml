description: ! 'MissingPy is two things:


  A Haskell binding for many C and Python libraries for tasks such as

  data compression, databases, etc.  This can be found in the

  MissingPy module tree.


  Also, it''s a low-level Haskell binding to the Python interpreter to

  enable development of hybrid applications that use both

  environments.  This can be found in the Python module tree.  The

  Haskell bindings above use this environment.


  MissingPy permits you to call Python code from Haskell.  It does NOT

  permit you to call Haskell code from Python.


  MissingPy is the companion to my MissingH library, and integrates with

  it.'

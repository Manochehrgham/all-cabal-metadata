  the widely used Cygwin and MSYS projects, which provide Unix-like environments for
  Windows. MinTTY consoles behave differently from native Windows consoles (such as
  `cmd.exe` or PowerShell) in many ways, and in some cases, these differences make
  it necessary to treat MinTTY consoles differently in code.\n\nThe `mintty` library
  provides a simple way to detect if your code in running in a MinTTY console on Windows.
  It exports `isMinTTY`, which does the right thing 90% of the time (by checking if
  standard error is attached to MinTTY), and it also exports `isMinTTYHandle` for
  the other 10% of the time (when you want to check is some arbitrary handle is attached
  to MinTTY). As you might expect, both of these functions will simply return `False`
  on any non-Windows operating system.\n"

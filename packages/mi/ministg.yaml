description: ! 'ministg is an interpreter for a simple high-level operational semantics
  for the STG machine. The

  semantics is taken from the research paper "Making a fast curry: push/enter vs.
  eval/apply

  for higher-order languages", by Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton Jones. It provides
  the option

  to trace the execution of the interpreter, rendering each step in a HTML file. This
  is useful

  for understanding the behaviour of the STG machine, and also useful for experimenting
  with

  changes to the machine. It also supports an experimental call stack tracing facility.'

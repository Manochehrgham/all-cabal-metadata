synopsis: A tiny part of the lens library with no dependencies
changelog: ! '# 0.4.0.0


  * Added `folding`.

  * Renamed `Getter` and `Fold` to `SimpleGetter` and `SimpleFold` and put them into
  `Lens.Micro`. Genuine `Getter` and `Fold` are available in microlens-contra.

  * Replaced `Applicative (Const r)` constraints with `Monoid r` because it''s the
  same thing but easier to understand.


  # 0.3.5.0


  * Added `Lens.Micro.Extras` with `view`, `preview`, `Getter`, and `Fold`. Now you
  no longer need microlens-mtl if the only thing you need from it is `view`.


  # 0.3.4.1


  * Changed the description of the package from “A tiny part of the lens library which
  you can depend upon” to “A tiny part of the lens library with no dependencies” because
  the previous one was ambiguous (I admit I kinda liked that ambiguity, tho).


  # 0.3.4.0


  * Added `non`.


  # 0.3.3.0


  * Added `filtered`.

  * Added Safe Haskell pragmas.


  # 0.3.2.0


  * Added `toListOf` back.

  * Added `to`.


  # 0.3.1.0


  * Added `LensLike` and `LensLike''`.

  * Added `failing`.


  # 0.3.0.0


  * Moved `Lens.Micro.Classes` into `Lens.Micro.Internal`.

  * Added `<%~`, `<<%~`, `<<.~`.


  # 0.2.0.0


  * Removed `toListOf`.

  * Removed `+~`, `-~`, `*~`, `//~` and the `Lens.Micro.Extras` module.


  # 0.1.5.0


  * Added `ix` and `at`.

  * Added `traversed`.

  * Moved some things into `Lens.Micro.Internal`.

  * Bumped base version.


  # 0.1.3.0


  * Moved some things into `Lens.Micro.Type` and `Lens.Micro.Classes`.

  * `Each` and `Field*` aren''t exported by `Lens.Micro` now.


  # 0.1.2.0


  * Added `each`.


  # 0.1.1.0


  * Added `ASetter''`, which is useful because we can''t provide real `Setter` and
  `Setter''`.


  # 0.1.0.0


  First release.

description: ! 'This is an extract from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens>
  (with no dependencies). It''s not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for “real world”,
  but merely a small one. It is compatible with lens, and should have same performance.
  It also has better documentation.


  Use this library:


  * if you want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don''t want
  to depend on lens


  * if you are new to lenses and want a small library to play with, but don''t want
  to use something “inferior” or have to relearn things when/if you switch to lens


  Don''t use this library:


  * if you need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, or actually anything else which
  isn''t defined here


  * if you want a library with a clean, understandable implementation (in which case
  you''re looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple lens-simple>)


  If you''re writing an application which uses lenses more extensively, look at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-platform
  microlens-platform> – it combines features of most other microlens packages (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-mtl
  microlens-mtl>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-th microlens-th>,
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>).


  If you want to export getters or folds and don''t mind the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/contravariant
  contravariant> dependency, please consider using <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-contra
  microlens-contra>.


  There''s a longer readme <https://github.com/aelve/microlens#readme on Github>,
  you should read it if you''re interested about using this library.


  If you haven''t ever used lenses before, read <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-tutorial/docs/Control-Lens-Tutorial.html
  this tutorial>. (It''s for lens, but it applies to microlens just as well.)


  Note that microlens has /no/ dependencies starting from GHC 7.10 (base-4.8). Prior
  to that, it has to depend on transformers-0.2 or above.'

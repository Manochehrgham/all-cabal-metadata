description: ! 'This is an extract from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens>
  (with no dependencies). It''s not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for “real world”,
  but merely a small one. It is compatible with lens, and should have same performance.
  It also has better documentation.


  Use this library:


  * if you want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don''t want
  to depend on lens


  * if you are new to lenses and want a small library to play with, but don''t want
  to use something “inferior” or have to relearn things when/if you switch to lens


  Don''t use this library:


  * if you need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, or actually anything else which
  isn''t defined here


  * if you think lenses compose “in the wrong order” (in which case you''re looking
  for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fclabels fclabels>)


  If you''re writing an application which uses lenses more extnesively, look at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-platform
  microlens-platform> – it combines features of all other microlens packages (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-mtl
  microlens-mtl>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-th microlens-th>,
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>).


  There''s a longer readme <https://github.com/aelve/microlens#readme on Github>,
  you should read it if you''re still interested about using this library.


  Note that microlens has /no/ dependencies starting from GHC 7.10 (base-4.8). Prior
  to that, it has to depend on transformers-0.2 or above.'

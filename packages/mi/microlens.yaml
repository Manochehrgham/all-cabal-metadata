synopsis: A tiny part of the lens library which you can depend upon
changelog: ! '# 0.1.3.0


  * Moved some things into `Lens.Micro.Type` and `Lens.Micro.Classes`.

  * `Each` and `Field*` aren''t exported by `Lens.Micro` now.


  # 0.1.2.0


  * Added `each`.


  # 0.1.1.0


  * Added `ASetter''`, which is useful because we can''t provide real `Setter` and
  `Setter''`.


  # 0.1.0.0


  First release.

description: ! 'This is an extract from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens>

  (with no dependencies). It''s not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for

  “real world”, but merely a small one. It is compatible with lens, and

  should have same performance. It also has better documentation.


  Use this library:


  * if you want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but

  don''t want to depend on lens


  * if you are new to lenses and want a small library to play with,

  but don''t want to use something “inferior” or have to relearn things

  when/if you switch to lens


  Don''t use this library:


  * if you need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, @at@, @ix@,

  or actually anything else which isn''t defined here


  * if you think lenses compose “in the wrong order” (in which case

  you''re looking for

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fclabels fclabels>)


  Note that microlens has /no/ dependencies starting from GHC 7.10

  (base-4.8). Prior to that, it has to depend on transformers-0.2 or above.


  Also note that it''s not done yet and there''s a lot of things missing

  and I''m still writing a tutorial for it.'

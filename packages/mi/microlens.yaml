description: ! 'This is an extract from the @lens@ library (with only 1 dependency).

  It''s not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for “real world”, but merely

  a small one. It is compatible with @lens@, and should have same

  performance.


  Use this library:


  * if you want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but

  don''t want to depend on @lens@

  * if you are new to lenses and want a small library to play with,

  but don''t want to use something “inferior” or have to relearn things

  when/if you switch to @lens@


  Don''t use this library:


  * if you need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, @at@, @ix@,

  or actually anything else which isn''t defined here

  * if you think lenses compose “in the wrong order” (in which case

  you''re looking for @fclabels@)


  Note that microlens has /no/ dependencies starting from GHC 7.10

  (base-4.8). Prior to that, it has to depend on transformers-0.2 or above.'

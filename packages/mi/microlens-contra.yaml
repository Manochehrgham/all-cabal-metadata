description: ! 'This package provides @Fold@ and @Getter@ that are fully compatible
  with lens; the downside is that this package depends on contravariant, which in
  its turn depends on a lot of other packages (but still less than lens).


  The difference between @Fold@ and @SimpleFold@ is that you can use e.g. @takingWhile@\/@droppingWhile@
  and @backwards@ on the former but not on the latter. Most functions from lens that
  work with @Fold@ would work with @SimpleFold@ as well, tho.


  This package is a part of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens microlens>
  family; see the readme <https://github.com/aelve/microlens#readme on Github>.'

changelog: ! "# Revision history for skylighting\n\n## 0.1.0.0  -- 2016-12-23\n\n*
  Initial release\n\n## 0.1.0.1  -- 2016-12-23\n\n* Fixed bug in LaTeX renderer (backslash
  in wrong position).\n\n## 0.1.1    -- 2017-01-19\n\n* Added breezeDark style, from
  breeze-dark.theme.\n* Fixed performance bug in regex application (#1).  This gives
  a\n  significant speedup, especially for inputs with long lines.\n\n"

description: ! "skylighting\n===========\n\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv2+-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)\n[![travis
  build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jgm/skylighting.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jgm/skylighting)\n\nA
  Haskell syntax highlighting library with tokenizers derived\nfrom KDE XML syntax
  highlighting descriptions.\n\nA command-line highlighter, `skylighting`, is also
  provided.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThis library is the successor to [highlighting-kate],
  which had\nsome problems that were difficult to resolve given its\narchitecture.\n\nIn
  highlighting-kate, the XML syntax descriptions were converted\ninto individual parsec
  parsers, which were then compiled.  This\nmade it difficult to handle IncludeRules
  properly without\ncircular imports.  There was also no way to load a syntax\ndescription
  dynamically.\n\nSkylighting, by contrast, parses the XML syntax descriptions\ninto
  Haskell data structures, which are then interpreted by\na \"tokenize\" function.
  \ IncludeRules can now be handled\nproperly, and users can add new syntax descriptions\ndynamically.
  \ It is also now possible to convert `.theme` files\ndirectly into styles.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nTo
  install the latest release from Hackage, do\n\n    stack install skylighting\nor\n\n
  \   cabal install skylighting\n\nIf you want the command-line tool, set the `executable`
  flag\nusing `--flag \"skylighting:executable\"` in stack or\n`-fexecutable` in cabal.\n\nThe
  release tarballs include generated files not present in this\nrepository.  Building
  from this repository is a two-step\nprocess.  In the first step we build a program,\n`skylighting-extract`,
  which reads XML syntax highlighting\ndefinitions from the `xml` directory and writes
  Haskell source\nfiles.  In the second we actually build the library.\n\nUsing stack:\n\n
  \   make bootstrap\n    make\n\nUsing cabal:\n\n    cabal install -fbootstrap --disable-optimizations\n
  \   cabal run skylighting-extract -- xml/*.xml\n    cabal install -f-bootstrap --disable-optimizations\n\nCommand-line
  tool\n-----------------\n\nA command-line executable, `skylighting`, is installed
  if\nthe `executable` cabal flag is set in building.\n\nFor help, `skylighting --help`.\n\nAdding
  new syntaxes\n-------------------\n\nTo compile with additional syntaxes, simply
  add the syntax\ndefinition (XML) file to the `xml` directory and repeat the\nbootstrap
  build described above.\n\nNote that both the library and the executable can dynamically\nload
  syntax definitions, so you may not need to compile them\nin.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSkylighting
  is licensed under the GPL, because some of the xml\nsyntax descriptions from which
  its tokenizers are generated are\nGPL-licensed.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nKate

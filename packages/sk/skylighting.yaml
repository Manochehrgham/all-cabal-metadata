synopsis: syntax highlighting library
changelog: ! "# Revision history for skylighting\n\n## 0.2 -- 2017-02-19\n\n  * Restore
  Data, Typeable, Generic instances for basic types.\n    To do this, we remove reCompiled
  field from RE (API change).  Instead, we\n    have the tokenizer compile regexes
  the first time it encounters them,\n    memoizing the results.  Performance is not
  significantly worse.\n  * Use -fprof-auto-exported for profiling builds.\n  * Added
  benchmark for xml syntax definition parsing.\n  * Patched perl.xml (improperly escaped
  regex) (#8).\n    This fixes a perl regex compilation error for regex patterns\n
  \   with backslash as delimiter, e.g. m\\a\\.\n  * Add a flag to build with system
  pcre (Felix Yan).\n\n## 0.1.1.5  -- 2017-02-03\n\n  * Avoid depending on a PrintfArg
  instance for Text (#5).\n    This isn't provided in some older versions of the text
  library.\n    This change should allow the package to build on older platforms.\n\n##
  0.1.1.4  -- 2017-01-31\n\n  * Properly escape characters in subDynamic.\n    This
  fixes a problem that caused failures with\n\n        echo -e \"s\\0b\\0c\" | skylighting
  -s perl\n\n  * More efficient rewrite of char escaping for regexes.\n\n## 0.1.1.3
  \ -- 2017-01-29\n\n  * Increase test timeout to 6s.\n  * Avoid double {{}} in latex
  macros.\n  * Fixed problem compiling Format.LaTeX on older ghc versions (7.8.3)\n
  \   that can't take a Text as PrintfArg.\n\n## 0.1.1.2  -- 2017-01-28\n\n  * Added
  much more extensive testing to ensure that tokenizers\n    don't hang or drop input.\n
  \ * Fixed some issues with line-end and fallthrough context\n    handling.\n  *
  Fixed a bug in WordDetect handling which caused it to drop\n    input (#2).\n\n##
  0.1.1.1  -- 2017-01-21\n\n  * Optimized.  Speed is now comparable to highlighting-kate\n
  \   and often better.\n  * Added benchmarks.\n\n## 0.1.1    -- 2017-01-19\n\n  *
  Added breezeDark style, from breeze-dark.theme.\n  * Fixed performance bug in regex
  application (#1).  This gives a\n    significant speedup, especially for inputs
  with long lines.\n\n## 0.1.0.1  -- 2016-12-23\n\n  * Fixed bug in LaTeX renderer
  (backslash in wrong position).\n\n## 0.1.0.0  -- 2016-12-23\n\n  * Initial release\n\n"

description: ! "skylighting\n===========\n\n[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv2+-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)\n[![travis
  build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jgm/skylighting.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jgm/skylighting)\n\nA
  Haskell syntax highlighting library with tokenizers derived\nfrom KDE XML syntax
  highlighting descriptions.\n\nA command-line highlighter, `skylighting`, is also
  provided.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThis library is the successor to [highlighting-kate],
  which had\nsome problems that were difficult to resolve given its\narchitecture.\n\nIn
  highlighting-kate, the XML syntax descriptions were converted\ninto individual parsec
  parsers, which were then compiled.  This\nmade it difficult to handle IncludeRules
  properly without\ncircular imports.  There was also no way to load a syntax\ndescription
  dynamically.\n\nSkylighting, by contrast, parses the XML syntax descriptions\ninto
  Haskell data structures, which are then interpreted by\na \"tokenize\" function.
  \ IncludeRules can now be handled\nproperly, and users can add new syntax descriptions\ndynamically.
  \ It is also now possible to convert `.theme` files\ndirectly into styles.\n\nSkylighting
  is also faster than highlighting-kate, by a\nfactor of 3 in some cases.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nTo
  install the latest release from Hackage, do\n\n    stack install skylighting\nor\n\n
  \   cabal install skylighting\n\nIf you want the command-line tool, set the `executable`
  flag\nusing `--flag \"skylighting:executable\"` in stack or\n`-fexecutable` in cabal.\n\nThe
  release tarballs include generated files not present in this\nrepository.  Building
  from this repository is a two-step\nprocess.  In the first step we build a program,\n`skylighting-extract`,
  which reads XML syntax highlighting\ndefinitions from the `xml` directory and writes
  Haskell source\nfiles.  In the second we actually build the library.\n\nUsing stack:\n\n
  \   make bootstrap\n    make\n\nUsing cabal:\n\n    cabal install -fbootstrap --disable-optimizations\n
  \   cabal run skylighting-extract -- xml/*.xml\n    cabal install -f-bootstrap --disable-optimizations\n\nCommand-line
  tool\n-----------------\n\nA command-line executable, `skylighting`, is installed
  if\nthe `executable` cabal flag is set in building.\n\nFor help, `skylighting --help`.\n\nAdding
  new syntaxes\n-------------------\n\nTo compile with additional syntaxes, simply
  add the syntax\ndefinition (XML) file to the `xml` directory and repeat the\nbootstrap
  build described above.\n\nNote that both the library and the executable can dynamically\nload
  syntax definitions, so you may not need to compile them\nin.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSkylighting
  is licensed under the GPL, because some of the xml\nsyntax descriptions from which
  its tokenizers are generated are\nGPL-licensed.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nKate

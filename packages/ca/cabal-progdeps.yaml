description: ! 'This utility can be used to display the version dependency

  information for the program being built in the current directory.

  Essentially it parses the dist/setup-config and displays the

  information in a readable format.  This can be very helpful when

  adding version constraints to your package''s dependencies in that it

  shows what your package is currently built (or configured to be

  built) with.


  n.b. It''s called "progdeps" instead of "pkgdeps" because it''s

  examining the build information in the current directory and not

  actual packages.


  Usage: cabal-progdeps


  Works with cabal-dev and cabal.

description: ! 'A simple library that caches an expensive IO action. This produces
  an IO

  action that, when run, either runs the expensive action and saves its result

  for a period of time, or re-uses the saved value. This amortizes the cost of

  the expensive IO action without a lot of complexity.

  See the test program for an example of how to use it.'

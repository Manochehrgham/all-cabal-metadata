description: ! 'This package provides a RPM packaging tool for Haskell Cabal-based
  packages.


  cblrpm has commands to generate a RPM spec file and srpm for a package.

  It can rpmbuild packages, yum/dnf install their dependencies, prep packages,

  and install them. There are commands to list package dependencies and

  missing dependencies. The diff command compares the current spec file

  with a freshly generated one and the update command updates the spec file

  to latest version from Hackage.'

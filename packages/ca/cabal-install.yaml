description: ! "The cabal-install package\n=========================\n\nSee the [Cabal
  web site] for more information.\n\nThe `cabal-install` package provides a command
  line tool named `cabal`.\nIt uses the [Cabal] library and provides a user interface
  to the\nCabal/[Hackage] build automation and package management system. It can\nbuild
  and install both local and remote packages, including\ndependencies.\n\n[Cabal web
  site]: http://www.haskell.org/cabal/\n[Cabal]: ../Cabal/README.md\n\nInstalling
  the `cabal` command-line tool\n========================================\n\nThe `cabal-install`
  package requires a number of other packages, most of\nwhich come with a standard
  GHC installation. It requires the [network]\npackage, which is sometimes packaged
  separately by Linux distributions;\nfor example, on Debian or Ubuntu, it is located
  in the\n\"libghc6-network-dev\" package.\n\n`cabal` requires a few other Haskell
  packages that are not always\ninstalled. The exact list is specified in the [.cabal]
  file or in the\n[bootstrap.sh] file. All these packages are available from [Hackage].\n\nNote
  that on some Unix systems you may need to install an additional\nzlib development
  package using your system package manager; for example,\non Debian or Ubuntu, it
  is located in the \"zlib1g-dev\" package; on\nFedora, it is located in the \"zlib-devel\"
  package. It is required\nbecause the Haskell zlib package uses the system zlib C
  library and\nheader files.\n\nThe `cabal-install` package is now part of the [Haskell
  Platform], so you\ndo not usually need to install it separately. However, if you
  are\nstarting from a minimal GHC installation, you need to install\n`cabal-install`
  manually. Since it is an ordinary Cabal package,\n`cabal-install` can be built the
  standard way; to facilitate this, the\nprocess has been partially automated. It
  is described below.\n\n[.cabal]: cabal-install.cabal\n[network]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network\n[Haskell
  Platform]: http://www.haskell.org/platform/\n\nQuick start on Unix-like systems\n--------------------------------\n\nAs
  a convenience for users on Unix-like systems, there is a\n[bootstrap.sh] script
  that will download and install each of\n`cabal-install`'s dependencies in turn.\n\n
  \   $ ./bootstrap.sh\n\nIt will download and install the dependencies. The script
  will install the\nlibrary packages (vanilla, profiling and shared) into `$HOME/.cabal/`
  and the\n`cabal` program into `$HOME/.cabal/bin/`. If you don't want to install
  profiling\nand shared versions of the libraries, use\n\n    $ EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTS=\"\"
  ./bootstrap.sh\n\nYou then have the choice either to place `$HOME/.cabal/bin` on
  your\n`$PATH` or move the `cabal` program to somewhere on your `$PATH`. Next,\nyou
  can get the latest list of packages by running:\n\n    $ cabal update\n\nThis will
  also create a default configuration file, if it does not\nalready exist, at `$HOME/.cabal/config`.\n\nBy
  default, `cabal` will install programs to `$HOME/.cabal/bin`. If you\ndo not want
  to add this directory to your `$PATH`, you can change\nthe setting in the config
  file; for example, you could use the\nfollowing:\n\n    symlink-bindir: $HOME/bin\n\n\nQuick
  start on Windows systems\n------------------------------\n\nFor Windows users, a
  precompiled program ([cabal.exe]) is provided.\nDownload and put it somewhere on
  your `%PATH%` (for example,\n`C:\\Program Files\\Haskell\\bin`.)\n\nNext, you can
  get the latest list of packages by running:\n\n    $ cabal update\n\nThis will also
  create a default configuration file (if it does not\nalready exist) at\n`C:\\Documents
  and Settings\\%USERNAME%\\Application Data\\cabal\\config`.\n\n[cabal.exe]: http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-install-latest/\n\nUsing
  `cabal`\n=============\n\nThere are two sets of commands: commands for working with
  a local\nproject build tree and those for working with packages distributed\nfrom
  [Hackage].\n\nFor the list of the full set of commands and flags for each command,\nrun:\n\n
  \   $ cabal help\n\n\nCommands for developers for local build trees\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe
  commands for local project build trees are almost the same as the\n`runghc Setup`
  command-line interface you may already be familiar with.\nIn particular, it has
  the following commands:\n\n  * `cabal configure`\n  * `cabal build`\n  * `cabal
  haddock`\n  * `cabal clean`\n  * `cabal sdist`\n\nThe `install` command is somewhat
  different; it is an all-in-one\noperation. If you run `cabal install` in your build
  tree, it will\nconfigure, build, and install. It takes all the flags that `configure`\ntakes
  such as `--global` and `--prefix`.\n\nIn addition, `cabal` will download and install
  any dependencies that are\nnot already installed. It can also rebuild packages to
  ensure a\nconsistent set of dependencies.\n\n\nCommands for released Hackage packages\n--------------------------------------\n\n
  \   $ cabal update\n\nThis command gets the latest list of packages from the [Hackage]
  server.\nOn occasion, this command must be run manually--for instance, if you\nwant
  to install a newly released package.\n\n    $ cabal install xmonad\n\nThis command
  installs one or more named packages, and all their\ndependencies, from Hackage.
  By default, it installs the latest available\nversion; however, you may specify
  exact versions or version ranges. For\nexample, `cabal install alex-2.2` or `cabal
  install parsec < 3`.\n\n    $ cabal list xml\n\nThis does a search of the installed
  and available packages. It does a\ncase-insensitive substring match on the package
  name.\n\n\n[Hackage]: http://hackage.haskell.org\n[bootstrap.sh]: bootstrap.sh\n"

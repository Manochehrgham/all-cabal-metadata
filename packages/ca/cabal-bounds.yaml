description: ! 'A command line program for managing the bounds/versions of the dependencies
  in a cabal file.


  ''cabal-bounds'' is able to do these things with the bounds of the dependencies
  in the cabal file:


  * drop them


  * update them by the library versions of the current cabal build


  * update them by the library versions of a haskell platform release


  * update them by the library versions specified by a file


  * dump the libraries/dependencies and their lower bound versions from the cabal
  file(s) into a file


  For further details please consult the <https://github.com/dan-t/cabal-bounds README>.


  /Installation/


  You have to ensure, that the ''Cabal'' library of ''cabal-bounds'' matches the one
  used by the ''cabal'' binary:


  > $ cabal --version

  > cabal-install version 1.18.0.2

  > using version 1.18.1 of the Cabal library


  > $ cabal install --constraint="Cabal == 1.18.1" cabal-bounds


  If you update the ''cabal'' binary and the used ''Cabal'' library changes, then
  you have to rebuild ''cabal-bounds''.


  /Issues/


  Perhaps the currently most annoying thing is, that you have to live with the reformating
  of your

  ''cabal'' file done by the pretty printer of the ''Cabal'' library.


  To reformat your ''cabal'' file without changing any bounds you can call ''cabal-bounds''
  with the name of

  a section that isn''t present in the ''cabal'' file:


  > $ cabal-bounds drop --executable=blub myproject.cabal'

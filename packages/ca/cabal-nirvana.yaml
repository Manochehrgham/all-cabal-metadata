description: ! 'This tool takes a list of known compatible versions of libraries and
  forces them to be used. This should bypass a lot of cabal dependency hell, thereby
  inducing nirvana.


  Originally, the idea was to use constraints in the Cabal config file to force this,
  but unfortunately there''s a bug in cabal-install which prevents that from being
  possible. Instead, this tool now filters the list of available packages available.


  The simplest usage is to just run cabal-nirvana. This will perform a few steps:


  1. Perform a cabal update


  2. Download the most recent version of the blessed package list.


  3. Modify the list of packages downloaded in the cabal update by the list of blessed
  packages.


  If you want to leave Nirvana, just perform a normal cabal update.'

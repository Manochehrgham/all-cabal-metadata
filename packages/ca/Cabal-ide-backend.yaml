description: ! 'NOTE: This is a temporary fork of Cabal necessary for

  <https://github.com/fpco/ide-backend>. It is not intended as a replacement for

  the standard Cabal package, and should in general not be used at all outside of

  ide-backend.


  The Haskell Common Architecture for Building Applications and

  Libraries: a framework defining a common interface for authors to more

  easily build their Haskell applications in a portable way.


  The Haskell Cabal is part of a larger infrastructure for distributing,

  organizing, and cataloging Haskell libraries and tools.'

description: ! 'This is a MacPorts-like maintenance command of

  Haskell cabal packages. Some part of this program is a wrapper to

  "ghc-pkg" and "cabal".

  If you are always confused due to inconsistency of two commands,

  or if you want a way to check all outdated packages,

  or if you want a way to remove outdated packages recursively,

  this command helps you.'

description: ! 'I really like having sandboxes baked into cabal-install.


  However, I got tired of waiting for big packages like Yesod and Lens to

  compile in project after project that used them. However, I still didn''t want

  to install them in the user database. I wanted to maintain /some/ sandboxing

  among a group of projects that all share a common set of packages, but I wanted

  to be able to switch from them or upgrade them easily.


  That''s the itch I was trying to scratch with `castle`.


  It allows you to share one Cabal sandbox between multiple projects. This keeps

  the package versions for all of these projects in line. It also means that you

  don''t have to constantly be re-installing everything, but you still get the

  ability to blow away a set of packages without borking your whole system.'

description: ! 'Command line access to the cabal package description

  files.


  cabalQuery allows you to query one or more .cabal files

  for fields that may be useful in other contexts, such

  as a build system, where you may need the version number,

  lincense, authors, copyright, etc.. in a programatic way,

  but without access to the Cabal libraries.'

description: ! '''cabalg'' is an alias for installing cabal package from a git source
  repository.


  E.g.


  @$ git clone https:\/\/github.com\/author\/foo

  $ git clone https:\/\/github.com\/author\/bar

  $ cabal install foo\/foo.cabal bar\/bar.cabal baz.cabal

  @


  could be abbreviated by


  @$ cabalg https:\/\/github.com\/author\/foo https:\/\/github.com\/author\/bar --
  biegunka.cabal

  @


  It also supports arbitrary git revisions mentioning like


  @ $ cabalg https:\/\/github.com\/baz\/quux\@f524f97

  @


  Necessary arguments could be passed to ''cabal install'' with ''--'' delimiter like


  @$ cabalg \<repo1\> ... \<repoN\> [\-\- \<cabal-install args\>]

  @


  Please notice, that ''--single-branch'' flag  comes with git-1.7.10 (<https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/28/418>)
  and later, so you probably want to have it.


  It''s supposed to be Windows-compatible (not sure about the tests)'

description: ! 'GUI applications on Mac OSX must be run as application /bundles/;

  these wrap an executable in a particular directory structure which

  can also carry resources such as icons, program metadata, other

  binaries, and copies of shared libraries.

  This package provides Cabal support for creating such application

  bundles.

  For more information about OSX application bundles, look for the

  /Bundle Programming Guide/ on the /Apple Developer Connection/

  website, <http://developer.apple.com/>.'

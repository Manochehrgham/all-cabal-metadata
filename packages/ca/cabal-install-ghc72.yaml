description: ! 'The \''cabal\'' command-line program simplifies the process of managing

  Haskell software by automating the fetching, configuration, compilation

  and installation of Haskell libraries and programs.


  cabal-install-0.10.2 does not build with the packages that come with ghc-7.2.

  This package is a copy of cabal-install-0.10.2 with dependency version changes made
  in

  the cabal file and the bootstrap.sh file to be compatible with ghc-7.2 packages.

  Thanks to beastaugh on github for describing these changes at https://gist.github.com/1169332.

  This package will be removed once a new version of cabal-install comes

  out that is compatible with the next version of ghc, 7.4.


  Known bug: cabal sdist does not work with the version. You must build your own source

  package using tar czf.'

description: ! 'Have you ever needed to get information from a cabal file in a shell

  script? Now you can! cabal-info exposes a simple command-line

  interface to the cabal file format.


  There is also a library interface, to solve tasks based on searching

  for a .cabal file and then doing something with it.


  See the <https://github.com/barrucadu/cabal-info README> for more

  details.'

description: ! 'This library provides the following instances

  for the ToString class:


  * ByteString


  * Doc


  * Text


  Note that the instances can be enabled or disabled

  based on cabal flags.


  The idea is that eventually all packages providing string-like

  types will provide instances for ToString themselves.

  In the mean time this package is here to provide them.'

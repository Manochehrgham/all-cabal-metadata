description: ! 'At its most general, Top is a framework for constructing abstract
  interpretations

  which focuses on giving good feedback on why an abstract interpretation does not
  give

  any useful information. In a mathematical notation this is usually made explicit
  by

  returning the top element of a (complete) lattice. This is also one of the reasons

  for the name of the project.'

description: ! 'This library provides a single global lock.  You can use it, for example,

  to protect a thread-unsafe C library.


  The implementation does not use @unsafePerformIO@.  It should be safe

  against GHC bugs such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5558>.


  You can use this library as-is, or as a template for including a similar

  lock in your own Haskell project.


  This library requires that the C compiler invoked by Cabal is GCC 4.1 or

  newer.'

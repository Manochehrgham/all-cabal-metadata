description: ! 'A Haskell binding for GLFW, a window system independent toolkit

  for writing OpenGL programs. For more information about the C

  library on which this binding is based, please see

  <http://www.glfw.org>. Note that this binding comes with an

  older GLFW C version 2.7.9 due to incompatible API changes in

  GLFW since 3.0 (for example, the removal of texture functions).

  If you want to use newer GLFW C versions, install Haskell package

  GLFW-b instead.'

description: ! 'GLURaw is a raw Haskell binding for the GLU 1.3 OpenGL utility library.
  It is

  basically a 1:1 mapping of GLU''s C API, intended as a basis for a nicer

  interface.


  OpenGL is the industry''s most widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics

  application programming interface (API), incorporating a broad set of

  rendering, texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful visualization

  functions. For more information about OpenGL and its various extensions,

  please see <http://www.opengl.org/>

  and <http://www.opengl.org/registry/>.'

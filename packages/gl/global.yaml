description: ! 'The "global" library enables the declaration of unique top-level

  declarations, including references to mutable state accessible via IO.


  Conceptually, this library defines primitive means of unique declarations,

  whose internal implementation is hidden from users, and uses Template

  Haskell to provide a public interface.  Thus, it is not necessarily

  portable across various implementations.  It is currently designed to be

  compatible with GHC.  Users do not need to be aware of the internal,

  low-level implementation; if a more portable, stable means of providing the

  same functionality becomes available, the library can be updated without

  changing the provided public interface.


  While this library provides the basis for an alternative approach to

  managing state, users should consider using instead the @transformers@

  library''s StateT transformer, possibly accompanied with @fclabels@ to

  manage hierarchical state (libraries that provide a higher-level means of

  managing monad stacks based on transformers include @mtl@, @monads-tf@, and

  @monad-operations@).  This library might be more appropriately used for

  other purposes, such as to provide a means to directly translate C to

  Haskell with a result whose style more closely resembles that of the

  original code.  Users should also consider using the language feature

  @ImplicitParams@.


  Examples of small programs that use this library are provided in the

  repository in which it resides.'

description: ! 'Ray Tracer capable of rendering a variety of primitives,

  with support for CSG (difference and intersection of solids),

  BIH-based acceleration structure, and ability to load NFF

  format files.  The rendering algorithms have been abstracted

  to an external library, GlomeTrace.  This is just a front-end

  to the library that renders scenes into an SDL window.'

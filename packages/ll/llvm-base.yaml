description: ! 'FFI bindings to the LLVM compiler toolkit.


  We try to stay up to date with LLVM releases.  The current version

  of this package is compatible with at least LLVM 3.2.  Please

  understand that the package may or may not work against older LLVM

  releases; we don''t have the time or resources to test across

  multiple releases.


  * New in 3.2: Builds against LLVM 3.2, new mid-level Wrapper interface and ST-based
  pure interface


  * New in 3.0: Builds against LLVM 3.0.


  * New in 0.9.1.1: Builds against LLVM 2.9.


  * New in 0.9.1.0: Util.Memory for memory related intrinsics.


  * New in 0.9.0.0: Adapted to LLVM 2.8 (removed support for Union types).'

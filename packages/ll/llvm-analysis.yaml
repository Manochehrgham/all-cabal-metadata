description: ! 'A Haskell library for analyzing LLVM bitcode.  To convert

  bitcode to the format used by this library, see the

  llvm-data-interop package.


  This library attempts to provide some basic program analysis

  infrastructure and aims to scale to large bitcode files.


  There are some useful tools built on top of this library

  available in the llvm-tools package.


  Changes since 0.2.0:

  * LLVM 3.3 support (contributed by Patrick Hulin)

  * Metadata format change.  Metadata type entries no longer have

  a MetaDWFile.  Instead, file and directory names are stored

  directly in each MetaDW*Type.  This change lets us more easily

  accommodate changes in LLVM 3.3 (while supporting older versions).

  * Under LLVM 3.3, the ''metaCompileUnitIsMain'' field of MetaDWCompileUnit

  is always False.  This disappeared in LLVM 3.3, but removing it would

  be an unnecessary API break, I think.'

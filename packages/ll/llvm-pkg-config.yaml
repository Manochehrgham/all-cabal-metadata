description: ! 'Building the @llvm-base@ package is fragile due to its configuration
  process.

  It would be much simpler, if LLVM would support pkg-config

  since this is nicely integrated in Cabal.

  However, LLVM developers do not seem to care much about it:

  <http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=9405>.

  If we are lucky we get pkg-config support in Debian Linux.

  Until this comes true, you can use this program.

  It calls @llvm-config@ and writes its output to a PC file.


  > llvm-pkg-config


  calls default @llvm-config@ and writes the generated file to standard output.


  > sudo llvm-pkg-config --install


  installs the PC file at a default location.

  This should be the standard task to perform.


  > llvm-pkg-config --llvm-config=/custom/path/to/llvm-config


  if you have multiple versions of LLVM installed

  you may choose an @llvm-config@ other than the default one.'

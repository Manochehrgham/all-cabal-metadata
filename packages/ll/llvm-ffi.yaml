description: ! 'FFI bindings to the LLVM compiler toolkit.


  Installation is based on @pkg-config@

  since this is best supported by Cabal.

  This requires an @llvm.pc@ file

  which unfortunately is not generated by the LLVM source package.

  You may be lucky that your distribution package includes that file.

  If not, you can generate it yourself

  using the @llvm-pkg-config@ package.


  We try to stay up to date with LLVM releases.

  The current version of this package is compatible with LLVM 3.4.

  Please understand that the package may or may not work

  against older LLVM releases.

  We don''t have the time or resources to test across multiple releases.'

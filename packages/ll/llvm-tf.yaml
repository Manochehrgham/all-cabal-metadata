description: ! 'High-level bindings to the LLVM compiler toolkit

  using type families instead of functional dependencies.


  We use the same module names as the @llvm@ package,

  which makes it harder to work with both packages from GHCi.

  You may use the @-hide-package@ option.

  We may change the module names later.


  A note on versioning:

  The first two version numbers match the version of LLVM.

  In order to be able to improve the Haskell API for the same version of LLVM,

  I use the first three numbers of the Cabal package version

  as the major version in the sense of the Package Versioning Policy PVP.

  That is, a bump from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 may contain substantial API changes,

  a bump from 3.0.0.0 to 3.0.0.1 may contain API extensions,

  and a bump from 3.0.0.0.0 to 3.0.0.0.1 may contain API-preserving bugfixes.'

description: ! 'This package requires the entirety of Hackage to be built.

  The joke started when a colleague liked the

  @leftToMaybe :: Either a b -> Maybe a@ function from @either@, which has a

  *huge* footprint compared to the utility it provides.

  This got us thinking about seemingly small packages that have lots of hidden

  transitive dependencies, e.g. "only" @base@, @lens@ and @yesod@. And that''s

  where `acme-everything` was born, which (transitively) depends on the

  entirety of Hackage.'

description: ! 'Fast Fourier transform and convolution via the @accelerate@ package.

  It uses many of the common tricks to achieve optimal speed

  for every size of the data set,

  but it does not contain low-level optimizations.


  * For CUDA specific optimizations please see

  @cufft@ and @accelerate-fft@ and @accelerate-cufft@ packages.


  * For CPU specific optimizations cf. @accelerate-fftw@ package.'

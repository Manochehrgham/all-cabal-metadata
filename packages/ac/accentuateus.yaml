description: ! 'Accentuate.us (<http://accentuate.us/>) is a free

  and open-source web service that makes computer

  input really easy for over 115 languages. Using

  statistics, it will automatically add diacritics

  (\"special characters\") to otherwise plain text.

  In support of being an open web service, an API is

  provided and documented at

  <http://accentuate.us/api>, which is implemented

  by this package.'

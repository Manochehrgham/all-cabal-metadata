description: ! 'Adds various type-system tricks to AC-Vector.

  (Requires several language extensions, including

  type families.)

  Added missing @Vector Point@ constraint to @HasSpace@

  class. Consequently removed @HasSpace Range@ instance.

  Added @unions@ method to @BoundingBox@ class. Added

  @axis_range@ function.'

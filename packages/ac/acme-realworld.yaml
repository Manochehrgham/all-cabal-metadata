description: ! 'GHC represents an IO action internally as a function from one state
  of the

  world to the next:


  >State# RealWorld -> (# State# RealWorld, a #)


  This module provides a very useful capability stemming directly from this

  representation: the ability to save the current state of the universe and

  restore it later.  This provides a way to \"undo\" certain types of side

  effects in the IO monad:


  >import Acme.Missiles

  >import Acme.RealWorld

  >

  >main :: IO ()

  >main = do

  >    -- Save the current state of the universe

  >    world_as_we_know_it <- getWorld

  >

  >    -- Cause serious international side effects

  >    launchMissiles

  >

  >    -- After realizing that was a terrible, terrible mistake, restore the

  >    -- pre-war state of the universe.

  >    putWorld world_as_we_know_it'

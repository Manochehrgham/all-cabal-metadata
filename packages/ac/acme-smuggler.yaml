description: ! 'ACME Smuggler

  =============


  The () type has only one value, also called () with no

  internal structure.


  Nevertheless, acme-smuggler allows you to smuggle

  arbitrary values into () and discover them later:


  ```haskell

  > x = smuggle "hello"

  > :t x

  x :: ()


  > y = smuggle (7 :: Integer)

  > :t y

  y :: ()


  > discover x :: Maybe String

  Just "hello"

  > discover y :: Maybe Integer

  Just 7

  > discover x :: Maybe Integer

  Nothing

  ```

description: ! 'Sequence a set of Alternative actions in each possible order,

  based on \"Parsing Permutation Phrases\", by Arthur Baars,

  Andres Loeh and S. Doaitse Swierstra, /Haskell Workshop 2001/.

  This is particularly useful for constructing a parser for

  permutations of elements.

  This version has a slightly different interface from the paper.'

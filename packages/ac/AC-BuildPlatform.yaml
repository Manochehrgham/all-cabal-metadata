description: ! 'This package lets you easily query various facts about the system

  that your code is running on. Currently, it reports whether the

  operating system is \"Windows\" or \"Unix\", and also the name and

  version of the Haskell compiler used.


  This package implements lots of complicated trickery to determine

  the build environment. Once built, other packages can query this

  information without needing to do complex trickery themselves.


  See also the included @ReadMe.xhtml@ file.


  Changes:


  * If the configure step fails to detect the OS type, the configure

  step now /fails/.


  * A new file @Manual.hs@ allows you to override the

  auto-detected platform values with whatever you want. (See

  @ReadMe.xhtml@ for details.)


  * All the platform queries no longer return @Maybe@ values. (This

  breaks API compatibility, hence the version bump.)'

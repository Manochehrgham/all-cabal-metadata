description: ! 'This package provides various functions and classes for dealing

  with things which are like Boolean values. It also defines a

  few useful instances. The main benefit is the ability to use

  the usual @&&@, etc. operators without having to invent new

  operator names for every kind of Bool-like thing.


  Changes:


  * Increase efficiency of @Boolean@ instance for @Bool@.


  * Shorten source code.


  * Remove function instance. (@Control.Monad.Instances@ provides

  an equivilent @Monad@ instance.)'

description: ! 'An interface to the

  <http://activitystrea.ms/ Activity Streams>

  specifications, using an @aeson@-based representation

  of the underlying ActivityStream structures.

  An ActivityStream is a representation of social

  activities in JSON format, using a standard set of

  structures. The specification is very flexible in

  allowing most fields to be omitted, while also

  allowing arbitrary new fields to be created when

  necessary. This library attempts to maximize

  type safety while retaining the flexibility present

  in the specification.'

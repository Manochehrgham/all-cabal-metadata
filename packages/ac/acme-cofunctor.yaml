description: ! 'A ''Cofunctor'' is a structure from category theory dual to ''Functor''.


  A ''Functor'' is defined by the operation ''fmap'':


  > fmap :: (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)


  This means that its dual must be defined by the following operation:


  > cofmap :: (b -> a) -> (f b -> f a)


  Since beginning his investigations, the author of this package has discovered

  that this pattern is /at least/ as commonly used as ''Functor''. In fact, many

  ubiquitous Haskell types (e.g. @[]@, ''Maybe'', @((->) a)@ turn out to have a

  ''Cofunctor'' instance.'

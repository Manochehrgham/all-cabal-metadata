description: ! 'This library provides a simple interface to the glibc @strfry@

  function, addressing the perennial programming quandary: \"How do I

  take good data in string form and painlessly turn it into garbage?\"


  For more information, consult the glibc documentation:

  <http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/strfry.html>


  Both @String@ and @ByteString@ interfaces are offered, as well as

  the raw FFI binding.'

description: ! 'Attempto Controlled English is a formally defined unambiguous language
  which

  is a subset of the English language. This package provides a tokenizer,

  parser and printer for that language. Specifically, it implements the

  declarative mood and the interrogative mood.

  The imperative mood is omitted at this time. Interpretation rules,

  conversion to FoL, or any further analysis is not implemented by this

  library.'

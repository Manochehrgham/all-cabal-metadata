description: ! 'This package is a thin layer over GHC''s low-level array

  primitives. It provides arrays with zero-origin integers

  for indicies. (These arrays also lack bounds checks.)

  They come in two flavours: mutable or immutable. (Both

  are boxed and lazy, however. There are no unboxed arrays

  here.)

  The idea is that you can use this package as a starting

  point for building a more useful array package, without

  having to learn all GHC''s low-level internals for yourself.

  Changes:

  * Now builds with GHC 6.12.1'

description: ! 'Use the @mvc@ library to distill concurrent programs into pure and

  single-threaded programs using the @Model@-@View@-@Controller@ pattern.  This

  transformation lets you:


  * replay your program deterministically,


  * do property-based testing of your model (like @QuickCheck@), and:


  * equationally reason about your pure core.'

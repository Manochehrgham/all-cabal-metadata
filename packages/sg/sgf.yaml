description: ! 'This is a parser for the go\/igo\/weiqi\/baduk fragment of the SGF
  format.

  Encodings latin-1, utf-8, and ascii are supported, and the parser strives

  to be robust to minor errors, especially those made by the most common SGF

  editors.  There are plans to support other games and pretty-printing in

  future releases.'

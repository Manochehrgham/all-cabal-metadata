description: ! 'This library provides a typed and composable API for building spreadsheets.

  This differs from traditional spreadsheets in a few important ways:


  * you specify the relationship between inputs and outputs at compile time,

  not runtime, so that the relationship can be type-checked


  * inputs of different types have different controls; for example, a `Bool`

  input creates a checkbox and a `Double` input creates a spin button


  * you can only output a single value; you simulate multiple outputs by

  emitting a tuple of values


  See the "Typed.Spreadsheet" module for full examples with code and pictures'

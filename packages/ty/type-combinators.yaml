description: ! 'I put this library together first and foremost so that

  I wouldn''t need to constantly rewrite the same code

  that uses these types, but also because I noticed a

  growing trend of writing and rewriting bits and pieces

  of code for these types all over the Haskell community.

  Hopefully, this helps! Contributions, criticisms, and

  thoughts are very welcome.  -kylcarte'

description: ! 'This is a simple implementation of type-level natural

  numbers that only requires DeriveDataTypeable.  Operations

  requiring more language extensions have been split into a

  separate package.


  The difference between this package and the many

  others on Hackage implementing type-level

  naturals is its emphasis on simplicity.  It only

  supports non-negative natural numbers, and only

  the successor and predicessor operations.  It

  represents natural numbers using a type-level

  linked list, so it is not intended to be used for

  representing large numbers.  Pre-defined aliases

  for natural numbers up to 15 are provided.


  The code for this package was largely taken from

  the excellent Vec package; I created this package

  with the intent of making this functionality more

  widely available.


  Difference from 1.0:  Added instances for Typeable, and

  word synonyms for N0...N15.


  Difference from 1.1:  Performance enhancements for

  naturalNumberAsInt.  Simplified Show implementation.


  Difference from 1.1.1:  Gave up on Haskell 2010

  compatibility since as of GHC 7.8 manually deriving from

  Typeable is no longer allowed; now I use

  DeriveDataTypeable to construct the instances.'

description: ! '# type-list

  Common list and tuple operations rewritten as type families that operate in the
  type level, on data-kinded types. Both uncurried (type family) and curried (GADTs
  to be used with the Apply type family from Singletons) are provided, to work around
  the inability to partially apply type families.

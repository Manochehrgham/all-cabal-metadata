description: ! 'In the presence of GADTs, sometimes a proof is

  needed that two types are equal. This package

  contains an equality type for this purpose, plus its

  properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive) and

  some useful operations (substitution, congruence,

  coercion/cast). It also contains a type class for

  producing equality proofs, providing some form of

  decidable equality on types.'

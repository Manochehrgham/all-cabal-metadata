description: ! 'This package provides newtype wrappers for separating data with specified

  endianness from other data of the same type with normal, system-specific

  endianness. Since these wrappers are newtypes, no runtime overhead is

  incurred.

  Currently the underlying ''EndianSensitive'' typeclass its instances are taken

  directly from the ''data-endian'' package. However, if Haskell or GHC ever gets

  a built-in equivalent, like as is proposed in

  ''http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7902'', it should be trivial to update

  this to use that instead.'

  About imm

  =========


  In a nutshell

  -------------


  **Technically**, *imm* is a little tool that retrieves a list of RSS/Atom feeds
  and fills a maildir with new items.


  **Functionally**, *imm* makes it possible to use mail readers for feeds, for the
  sake of *I-want-the-mutt-of-feed-readers* zealots.


  *imm* is written and configured in *Haskell*.


  Informations about versions, dependencies, source repositories and contacts can
  be found in hackage_.



  Need & purpose

  --------------


  Following numerous RSS/Atom feeds needs organization and aggregation.

  Such needs are usually met by feed readers.

  Although there are a lot of those, some people still feel unsatisfied with the existing
  implementations.


  The expected features of a feed reader could be defined as follows:


  - it retrieves items with the following attributes: an author, a date/time, a (possibly
  enriched) body;

  - items can be sorted, categorized, marked as read/unread, tagged, shared/forwarded;

  - items must be available from anywhere on the internet.


  Luckily, there''s already a widespread solution that provides such features: mail
  readers.

  Considering that, *imm* aims at projecting the RSS/Atom paradigm onto the mail one;
  this way, all the existing tools that work on mails can be leveraged to work on
  RSS/Atom feeds as well, no wheel reinventing.



  Function

  --------


  *imm* does only one thing and does it well: it downloads an RSS/Atom feeds list,
  and for each new item it writes a file in a local maildir. How and where to write
  mail files is setup in *imm*''s configuration file.


  No *SMTP* sending, no *IMAP* serving, no aggregating: those should be performed
  by external tools.



  Example usage

  -------------


  It is possible to setup a Google Reader-like on a server using the following steps:


  - schedule *imm* to check feeds regularly and write new items into a local maildir;

  - setup an IMAP server to publish the aforementioned maildir;

  - setup a webmail, bound to the IMAP server above, to read feeds from any computer
  connected to the internet.



  Getting started

  ---------------


  To get started, please fill the configuration file at ``~/.config/imm/imm.hs`` with
  your feeds list and settings. An example configuration file is provided with the
  package. Configuring *imm* requires basic knowledge of *Haskell* language.

  ## In a nutshell


  *imm* is a tool that does only one thing: it retrieves a list of RSS/Atom feeds,
  and executes arbitrary actions for each of them (e.g. sending a mail).


  Notably, *imm* makes it possible to use mail readers for feeds, for the sake of
  *I-want-the-mutt-of-feed-readers* zealots.


  *imm* is written and configured in *Haskell*. To get started, please consult documentation
  of `Imm.Boot` module.


  Informations about versions, dependencies, source repositories and contacts can
  be found in [hackage][1].



  ## Rationale


  Following numerous RSS/Atom feeds needs organization and aggregation, which is usually
  accomplished through feed readers.

  Although there are a lot of those, some people still feel unsatisfied with the existing
  implementations.


  The expected features of a feed reader could be defined as follows:


  - it retrieves a bunch of items that have some attributes: an author, a date/time,
  a (possibly enriched) body;

  - items can be sorted, categorized, marked as read/unread, tagged, shared/forwarded;

  - items must be available from anywhere on the internet.


  Luckily, there''s already a widespread solution that provides such features: mail
  readers.

  Considering that, *imm* can project the RSS/Atom paradigm onto the mail one; this
  way, all the existing tools that work on mails can be leveraged to work on RSS/Atom
  feeds as well, no wheel reinventing.

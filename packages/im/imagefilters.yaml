description: ! 'This package brings image filters comparable to PHP''s imagefilter
  functions. In the current release,

  these filters may only be used with the GD Haskell extension library, but in the
  future it may support

  other image management libraries, such as the new JuicyPixels library.


  imagefilters also supplies functionality for creating custom filters by using the
  ''pixelTransform'' function

  for per-pixel transformations, or the ''convolute'' function for the application
  of convolution matrices'

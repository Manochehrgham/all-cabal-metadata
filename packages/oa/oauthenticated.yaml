description: ! '/Warning/: This software is pre 1.0 and thus its API may change very

  dynamically while updating only minor versions. This package will follow the

  PVP once it reaches version 1.0.


  OAuth is a popular protocol allowing servers to offer resources owned by some

  user to a series of authorized clients securely. For instance, OAuth lets

  Twitter provide access to a user''s private tweets to the Twitter client

  registered on their phone.


  @oauthenticated@ is a Haskell library implementing OAuth protocols atop the

  minimalistic @http-client@ HTTP client library extracted from @http-conduit@.

  "Network.OAuth" offers simple functions for signing

  ''Network.HTTP.Client.Request''s along with tools for ''Network.OAuth.Cred''ential

  management and ''Network.OAuth.Server'' configuration. "Network.OAuth.Simple"

  provides a slightly more heavy-weight interface which manages the necessary state

  and configuration using a monad transformer stack.


  There''s also an implementation of OAuth''s three-legged credential acquisition

  protocol built atop the "Network.OAuth" API. This can be handled in both

  conformant and old-style modes: conformant will reject server responses which

  are not conformant with RFC 5849 (which builds atop community version OAuth

  1.0a) while old-style better allows for less-than-compliant servers. See

  ''Network.OAuth.Types.Params.Version'' for more details.


  Currently @oauthenticated@ only supports OAuth 1.0 and is in alpha. OAuth 2.0

  support is a potential goal, but it''s unclear if it can be transparently

  supported at a similar level of abstraction.'

synopsis: Run IO actions lazily while respecting their order
changelog: ! '0.1


  * System.IO.Lazy.T: remove MonadIO instance,

  liftIO did not satisfy MonadIO laws.

  You must use the new function LazyIO.interleave instead.

  A positive side-effect is that you do not need

  to depend explicitly on ''transformers'' anymore.

description: ! 'Run IO actions lazily while respecting their order.

  Running a value of the LazyIO monad in the IO monad is like starting a thread

  which is however driven by its output.

  That is, the LazyIO action is only executed as far as necessary

  in order to provide the required data.'

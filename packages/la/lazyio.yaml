synopsis: Run IO actions lazily while respecting their order
changelog: ! "0.1\n\n* System.IO.Lazy.T: remove MonadIO instance\n\n  liftIO did not
  satisfy MonadIO laws.\n  You must use the new function LazyIO.interleave instead.\n
  \ A positive side-effect is that you do not need\n  to depend explicitly on 'transformers'
  anymore.\n"

description: ! 'Run IO actions lazily while respecting their order.

  Running a value of the LazyIO monad in the IO monad is like starting a thread

  which is however driven by its output.

  That is, the LazyIO action is only executed as far as necessary

  in order to provide the required data.'

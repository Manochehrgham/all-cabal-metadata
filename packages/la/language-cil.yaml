description: ! 'Language-Cil is a Haskell library for manipulating CIL

  abstract syntax and generating .il files.


  Common Intermediate Language (CIL), formerly known as

  Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), is the lowest

  level language that runs on Microsoft .NET and Mono.


  This library is still  under development, it only supports

  a small subset of the full CIL.


  See <https://github.com/tomlokhorst/language-cil#readme>

  for an example of how to quickly get started.'

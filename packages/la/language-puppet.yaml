  system has been improved. It is now possible to know\n\tthe original host of an
  imported resource, which helps a lot in case of\n\tresource clashes\n* is_virtual
  fact\n* new stdlib functions: flatten, str2bool, validate_absolute_path\n* Hiera
  support\n* JSON output that is compatible with \"puppet apply\"\n* New addfacts
  command for the pdbquery utility\n* Support for the classes variable in templates\n*

  v0.10.2 (2013/10/27)\n## Bugs fixed\n* PVP support\n## New features\n* Support for
  properly setting instance variables before computing\n\ttemplates with native Ruby.\n\n#

  Resource, for easier debugging\n* Inclusion of three PuppetDB backends : dummy (no
  effect), TestDB (stored\n\tin a YAML file) and Remote (standard PuppetDB API)\n##
  Bugs fixed\n* This is a hack : variables declared in a parent (inheritance) can
  now be\n\toverriden. This is because inheritance is not handled like in Vanilla.
  As\n\tI do not really use inheritance, I am not sure if this is much of a\n\tbreakage.\n\n#
  v0.9.0 (2013/08/15)\n  Huge rewrite !\n* See http://lpuppet.banquise.net/blog/2013/08/15/version-0-dot-9-0-is-out-for-testing/\n\n#

  bugs about resource relationships.\n\n# v0.3.0 (2012/11/19)\n## New features\n*

"= Language-puppet\n\nimage:https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/language-puppet.svg[link=\"http://hackage.haskell.org/package/language-puppet\"]\nimage:https://www.stackage.org/package/language-puppet/badge/lts[link=\"https://www.stackage.org/lts/package/language-puppet\"]\nimage:https://www.stackage.org/package/language-puppet/badge/nightly[link=\"https://www.stackage.org/nightly/package/language-puppet\"]\nimage:https://travis-ci.org/bartavelle/language-puppet.svg?branch=master[\"Build
  Status\", link=\"https://travis-ci.org/bartavelle/language-puppet\"]\n\nA library
  to work with Puppet manifests, test them and eventually replace everything ruby.\n\n.Basic
  usage:\n```\npuppetresources -p /where/your/puppet/files/are -o node.name.com\n```\n\n.Easy
  build instructions:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/bartavelle/language-puppet.git\ncd
  language-puppet\n# Add ~/.local/bin to $PATH\nstack install\n```\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/pierrer/language-puppet/[A
  docker image] is available.\n\n== Puppetresources\n\nThe `puppetresources` command
  is a command line utility that let you interactively compute catalogs on your local
  computer.\nIt is much faster than its ruby counterpart, and has been designed for
  giving assistance to the Puppet catalog writer.\nThere are 4 different modes:\n\n*
  `--node` will display all resources on screen in a nice user-friendly colored fashion.\n*
  `--all` displays statitics and optionally shows dead code.\n* `--parse` only goes
  as far as parsing. No interpretation.\n* `--showcontent` to display file content.\n\nCatalog
  can be verified using strict or more permissive rules.\n\n=== Command line arguments\n\n`-p`
  or `--puppetdir`::\n\nThis argument is mandatory except in `parse` mode. It must
  point to the base of the puppet directory (the directory that contains the `modules`
  and `manifests` directories).\n\n`-o` or `--node`::\n\nEnable the `node mode`. This
  let you specify the name of the node you wish to compute the catalog for.\n\n`-a`
  or `-all`::\n\nEnable the `stats mode`. If you specify `allnodes` it will compute
  the catalogs for all nodes that are specified in `site.pp` (this will not work for
  regexp-specified or the default nodes). You can also specify a list of nodes separated
  by a comma.\n+\nCombined with `--deadcode`, it will display the list of puppet files
  that have not been used.\n+\nThis is useful as automated tests, to check a change
  didn't break something. You might want to run this option with `+RTS -N`.\n\n`-t`
  or `--type`::\n\nFilters the resources of the resulting catalog by type. Using PCRE
  regex is supported.\n\n`-n` or `--name`::\n\nFilters the resources of the resulting
  catalog by name. Using PCRE regex is supported.\n\n`-c` or `--showcontent`::\n\nIf
  `-n` is the exact name of a file type resource defined in the catalog, this will
  display the file content nicely. Useful for debugging templates.\n+\nExample: `puppetresources
  -p . -o mynodename -n '/etc/motd' --showcontent`\n\n`--loglevel` or `-v`::\n\nPossible
  values are : DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, ERROR\n\n`--pdburl`::\n\nExpects the
  url of a live PuppetDB.\n\n`--pdbfile`::\n\nExpects a path to a *fake* PuppetDB,
  represented as a YAML file on disk. This option is pretty slow but can be invaluable
  to test exported resources tricks.\n\n`--hiera`::\n\nExpects the path to the `hiera.yaml`
  file.\n\n`--ignoredmodules`::\n\nExpects a list of comma-separated modules. The
  interpreter will not try to parse and evaluate the defined types and classes from
  this module. This is useful for using modules that use bad\npractices forbidden
  by `puppetresources`.\n\n`--commitdb`::\n\nWhen this flag is set, exported resources,
  catalogs and facts are saved in the PuppetDB. This is useful in conjunction with
  `--pdbfile`.\n\n`--checkExported`::\n\nWhen this flag is set, exported resources
  are saved in the PuppetDB. This is useful in conjunction with `--pdbfile`.\n\n`-j`
  or `--JSON`::\n\nDisplays the catalog as a Puppet-compatible JSON file, that can
  then be used with `puppet apply`.\n\n`--strict`::\n\nEnable strict check.\nStrict
  is less permissive than vanilla Puppet.\nIt is meant to prevent some pitfalls by
  enforcing good practices.\nFor instance it refuses to\n  - silently ignore/convert
  `undef` variables\n  - lookup an hash with an unknown key and return `undef`.\n\n`--noextratests`::\n\nDisable
  the extra tests from `Puppet.OptionalTests`.\n\n`--parse`::\n\nEnable `parse mode`.
  Specify the puppet file to be parsed. Variables are not resolved. No interpretation.\n\n`--version`::\n\nOutput
  version information and exist.\n\n=== Settings defaults using a yaml file\n\nDefaults
  for some of these options can be set using a `/yourworkingdirectory/tests/defaults.yaml`
  file. For instance `OptionalTests` is checking that all users and groups are known.
  Because some of these users and groups might be defined outside puppet, a list of
  known ones is used internally. This can be overridden in that file using the key
  `knownusers` and `knowngroups`.\n\nPlease look at https://github.com/bartavelle/language-puppet/blob/master/tests/defaults.yaml[the
  template file] for a list of possible defaults.\n\n== pdbQuery\n\nThe `pdbquery`
  command will work with different implementations of PuppetDB (the official one with
  its HTTP API, the file-based backend and dummy ones). It can be used to:\n\n* export
  data from production PuppetDB to a file (in order to debug some issue with `puppetresources`).\n*
  query a Puppetdb\n\nHere is a list of command line arguments :\n\n`-l` or `--location`::\n\nThe
  URL of the PuppetDB when working with a remote PuppetDB, a file path when working
  with the file-based test implementation.\n\n`-t` or `--pdbtype`::\n\nThe type of
  PuppetDB to work with:\n\n* dummy: a dummy PuppetDB.\n* remote: a \"real\" PuppetDB,
  accessed by its HTTP API.\n* test: a file-based backend emulating a PuppetDB.\n\n.Commands\n\n`facts`::\nOutput
  facts for a specific node (json)\n\n`nodes`::\nOutput all nodes (json)\n\n`resources`::\nOutput
  all resources for a specific node (json)\n\n`dumpfacts`::\nDump all facts to `/tmp/allfacts.yaml`.\n\n`snapshot`::\nCreate
  a test DB from the current DB\n\n`addfacts`::\nAdds facts to the test DB for the
  given node name, if they are not already defined.\n\n`--version`::\nOutput version
  information and exit.\n\n== Unsupported Puppet idioms or features\n\npuppet functions::\n
  \ * the `require` function is not supported (see https://github.com/bartavelle/language-puppet/issues/17[issue
  #17])\n  * the deprecated `import` function is not supported (see https://github.com/bartavelle/language-puppet/issues/82[issue
  #82])\n\ncustom ruby functions::\n"

description: ! 'Currently the package only provides

  conversion between LaTeX escape sequences and Unicode characters.

  It is used in the @bibtex@ package.


  In the future we might add support

  for formatting Haskell values in LaTeX markup

  for automated report generation.


  See the packages @HaTeX@ for LaTeX document generation

  and @pandoc@ for document analysis and generation in multiple markup languages.'

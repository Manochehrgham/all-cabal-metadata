description: ! 'LambdaCube is a 3D rendering engine written entirely in Haskell.

  It targets newer graphics hardware. The engine uses Ogre3D''s mesh

  and material file format. The main goal of this project is to

  provide a modern and feature rich graphical backend for various

  Haskell projects (e.g. FRP libraries).


  While the interface looks huge on the surface, the only part of

  interest to application developers is the "Graphics.LambdaCube"

  module, and possibly "Graphics.LambdaCube.Loader.StbImage".  The

  rest is only exposed to make low-level interfacing possible.'

synopsis: Parser and pretty printer for the Thrift IDL format.
changelog: ! "0.6.0.1\n=======\n\n-   Export `Pretty` instances from `Language.Thrift.Types`
  instead of requiring\n    a separate import of the corresponding `Pretty` module.\n\n0.6.0.0\n=======\n\n-
  \  Added a pretty printer based on `ansi-wl-pprint`.\n-   Both pretty printing modules
  now export instances of `Pretty` for relevant\n    elements of the AST. These instances
  use `defaultConfig` for printing.\n\n0.5.0.0\n=======\n\nThe AST representation
  has been overhauled to be more consistent and\naccessible. As a result, this release
  contains a number of breaking changes:\n\n-   Moved `Header` records into `Include`
  and `Namespace` types.\n-   Moved `ConstDefinition` record into separate type, `Const`.\n-
  \  Moved `ServiceDefinition` record into separate type, `Service`.\n-   Moved `Type`
  records into separate types: `Typedef`, `Enum`, `Struct`,\n    `Union`, `Exception`,
  `Senum`.\n-   Renamed `FieldType` to `TypeReference`.\n-   Renamed parser and pretty
  printer for `TypeReference` to `typeReference`.\n-   Renamed the following record
  fields: `constType` to `constValueType`,\n    `typedefType` to `typedefTargetType`,
  `fieldType` to `fieldValueType`, and\n    `fieldDefault` to `fieldDefaultValue`.\n-
  \  Hide `function` parser and pretty printer.\n-   Moved type annotations for defined
  types into the records for the types\n    themselves.\n\nOther changes:\n\n-   Added
  lenses and prisms for AST types where appropriate.\n-   Parsing will fail if the
  end of the document is not reached when the parser\n    stops. This fixes the bug
  where the parser would stop half way through a\n    file when it saw a recoverable
  error.\n-   Added source annotations to headers, type references (`DefinedType`)
  and\n    constant value references (`ConstIdentifer`).\n-   Added `i8` as an alias
  for `byte`.\n-   Type annotations are now allowed to have no associated value.\n-
  \  Expose parsers and pretty printers for different headers and definitions.\n-
  \  Fixed a bug which would cause parsing to fail if a definition ended with a\n
  \   semicolon or a comma.\n-   Drop dependency on mtl.\n\n0.4.0.0\n=======\n\n-
  \  Add pretty printing module.\n-   Parsers of different constructors are no longer
  exported by the parsing\n    module; instead only the parsers for their corresponding
  types are\n    exported.\n-   Rename record for field requiredness from `fieldRequiredNess`
  to\n    `fieldRequiredness`.\n\n0.3.0.0\n=======\n\n-   Allow changing the underlying
  parser to any parser that implements the\n    `TokenParsing` class from `parsers`.\n-
  \  Add `thriftIDLParser` for standard use cases.\n-   Add `Language.Thrift.Parser.Trifecta`
  with a standard Trifecta-based\n    parser.\n\n0.2.0.0\n=======\n\n-   Track starting
  positions in source annotations.\n-   Move docs to a separate field.\n\n0.1.0.1\n=======\n\n-
  \  Allow `base` 4.9.\n\n0.1.0.0\n=======\n\n-   Initial release.\n"

description: ! "[![build-status]](https://travis-ci.org/abhinav/language-thrift)\n\n`language-thrift`
  provides a parser and pretty printer for the [Thrift IDL\nformat]. In addition to
  parsing the IDL, it keeps track of Javadoc-style\ncomments (`/** ... */`) and attaches
  them to the type, service, function, or\nfield, above which they were added. These
  are retained when the document is\nsent through the pretty printer.\n\nThe parser
  uses [`parsers`] to allow plugging in the underlying parser. A\ndefault [`trifecta`]
  based parser is provided.\n\nThe pretty printer supports both, [wl-pprint] and [ansi-wl-pprint].\n\nHaddock-generated
  docs are available on [Hackage] and [here].\n\n  [build-status]: https://travis-ci.org/abhinav/language-thrift.svg?branch=master\n

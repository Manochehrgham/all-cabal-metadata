description: ! "Parser for JavaScript\n---------------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/alanz/language-javascript.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/alanz/language-javascript)\n\nBased
  (loosely) on language-python\n\nHow to build\n------------\n\nLibrary:\n\n    cabal
  clean && cabal configure && cabal build\n\nTests:\n\n    cabal clean && cabal configure
  -fbuildtests && cabal build\n\nRunning the tests\n\n    ./dist/build/runtests/runtests\n\n\nTo
  debug the grammar\n\n    happy -iparse.txt -g -a  -d src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar5.y\n\nThis
  generates src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar.hs, delete this\nwhen done with
  the debug version\n\n\nUTF8/Unicode version\n--------------------\n\nAlex 3.0 now
  supports unicode natively, and has been included as a\ndependency in the cabal file.\n\nNote:
  The generation of the lexical analyser has been separated out,\n      to remove
  the install-time dependency on Alex. If any changes\n      need to be made to the
  lexer, the Lexer.x source lies in\n      src-dev, and the runalex.sh script will
  invoke Alex with the\n      appropriate directories.\n\nChanges\n-------\n\n```\n0.5.13.3
  Fix utf8-string lower bound typo no 2\n\n0.5.13.2 Fix utf8-string lower bound typo\n\n0.5.13.1
  Bump utf8-string dependency upper bound, and loosen others\n\n0.5.13 Put GHC 7.8.x
  -specific alex and happy versions, thanks\n       @simonmichael\n\n0.5.12 Put dependency
  on alex >= 3.0.5 in the cabal file, thanks @peti\n\n0.5.11 Remove pre-generated
  Lexer.hs as it does not work will all\n       versions of GHC. This means a current
  alex will have to be\n       installed before this package can be installed.\n\n0.5.10
  Bring in alex 3.1.3, allowing compatibility with GHC 7.8\n\n0.5.9 Relax array dependency
  for GHC 7.8.1, thanks @maoe\n\n0.5.8 Fixed compilation issue using GHC 7.6.3 on
  Mac OSX, thanks @albertov\n\n0.5.7 Remove the hs-source-dirs from test suite to
  prevent compilation\n      issues (@nomeata)\n\n      Introduce parseFileUtf8 to
  explicitly use utf8 for parsing a\n      file, and update tests to use it where
  needed. Closes #21\n\n0.5.6 Remove constraint on Alex 3.0.1, it is only required
  to make\n      changes to the lexer. Closes #19\n\n0.5.5 Updated version ranges
  for GHC 7.6.1, courtesy of @mietek\n      Note: requires alex 3.0.1 for development
  (not install)\n\n0.5.4 Fixed bug where lexer switches to regexp mode after a ']'\n
  \     char, reported by @aszlig\n\n0.5.3 Merge pull requests from @aszlig to add
  octal support, and to\n      allow leading zeros in exponents\n\n0.5.2 Merged pull
  request from @markwright added some missing test\n      files to the cabal file.\n
  \     Added runalex.sh and Lexer.x to the cabal file.\n\n0.5.1 Export CommentAnnotation(..).
  Simplify AST by getting rid of\n      JSFunctionBody, JSSourceElements, JSStatementBlock,
  JSStatementList.\n      They are replaced by JSBlock or a simple list.\n      Also
  fix lexer mode in presence of whitespace.\n      Changed way tests are invoked,
  to allow Travis integration.\n\n0.5.0 Rework AST to allow full round-trip parsing
  and output of\n      JavaScript. Breaks AST compatibility with prior versions\n\n0.4.10
  Moved Lexer.x into a separate directory, and made a script to\n       call alex
  to generate Lexer.hs. This means alex is not required\n       at install time\n\n0.4.9
  Make alex and happy versions more explicit. Expose the AlexSpan\n      data type,
  so parse error positions can be reported.\n\n0.4.8 Close issue https://github.com/alanz/language-javascript/issues/5
  by\n      correcting the lexical analyser for DecimalLiteral\n\n0.4.7 Continue ECMASCRIPT
  update, remove incorrect future reserved words for\n      \"code\", \"mode\", \"of\",
  \"one\", \"or\" and \"strict\", put in by accident/stupidity.\n\n0.4.6 Update to
  ECMASCRIPT 5.1 by allowing continuations in string literals\n      Include build
  dependencies on alex >= 3.0 and happy.\n\n0.4.5 Update cabal file and docs for Alex
  3.0, giving out of the box unicode support\n\n0.4.4 Allow unicode characters in
  comments\n\n0.4.3 correct lexer for decimalToken, only leading digit needs to be
  non-zero.\n\n0.4.2 Expose SrcSpan\n\n0.4.1 Expose AST.Node as well.\n\n0.4.0 Updated
  JSNode to include location information, and made the parse more true to the original
  by leaving blocks as such, not replacing with ';'.\n\n0.3.0 ECMA-262 edition 5 compliance.
  \ Required adding JSFunctionExpression and JSPropertyAccessor to the AST.\n\n0.2.2
  Heading toward compliance with edition 5. Trailing commas allowed in array literals
  too.\n\n0.2.1 Allow trailing comma in object literal\n\n0.2.0 ECMAScript 3 allows
  function expressions to have names, AST.JSFunctionExpression now reflects this\n\n0.1.0
  Simplified AST by removing JSElement and JSElementList components\n\n0.0.3 Support
  for unicode in source. At the moment it only supports\nUTF8 encoding, does not recognise
  byte order marks or UTF-16/UTF-32\n\n0.0.2 Multiline comments were processed in
  greedy form, now end of\ncomment recognised properly. Thanks to Tony Morris for
  reporting this.\n\n0.0.1 Initial release\n```\n\nEOF\n\n"

description: ! 'LambdaCube 3D is a domain specific language and library that makes

  it possible to program GPUs in a purely functional style.

  Programming with LambdaCube constitutes of composing a data-flow

  description, which is compiled into a specialised library. The

  language provides a uniform way to define shaders and compositor

  chains by treating both streams and framebuffers as first-class

  values.


  As a user of the library you only need to import the "LambdaCube.GL" and

  "LambdaCube.GL.Mesh" modules. You should check out the pointers at <http://lambdacube3d.wordpress.com/getting-started/>

  to understand the principle behind the library, and also have a good look

  at the @lambdacube-samples@ package.'

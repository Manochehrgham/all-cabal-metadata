description: LazyVault is a sandboxing tool to install libraries and executables with
  a sandboxed environment. At the moment it's only supported under Unix or Gnu Systems.
  This package has only been tested under Gnu/Linux however. This program creates
  cabal sandboxes which you can use globally. For a detailed explaination on how this
  works refer to the README file found on the github page.

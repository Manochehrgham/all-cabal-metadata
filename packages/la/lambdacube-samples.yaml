description: ! 'Executable samples to showcase the capabilities of LambdaCube

  3D. Each sample is a separate executable called

  @lambdacube-\<samplename\>@. The following samples are included

  (each is described in a separate blog post):


  * ''hello'': the canonical rotating cube


  * ''convolutionfilter'': a simple Gaussian blur (<http://lambdacube3d.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/optimising-convolution-filters/>)


  * ''shadowmapping'': variance shadow mapping (<http://lambdacube3d.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/variance-shadow-mapping/>)


  * ''cubemap'': cube mapped reflection using geometry shaders (<http://lambdacube3d.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/variance-shadow-mapping/>)


  * ''bulletexample'': integration with Bullet physics through Elerea;

  this sample is optional due to its dependence on Bullet, and you

  need to install the package with -fBulletInstalled to enable it.

description: ! 'A library and program for the creation,

  management, and installation of schema updates

  (called /migrations/) for a relational database.

  In particular, this package lets the migration

  author express explicit dependencies between

  migrations and the management tool automatically

  installs or reverts migrations accordingly, using

  transactions for safety.

  This package is written to support any

  HDBC-supported database, although at present only

  PostgreSQL is fully supported.

  To get started, see the included ''README.md'' and

  ''MOO.TXT'' files and the usage output for the

  ''moo'' command.'

description: ! "\ndbmigrations\n------------\n\nThis package contains a library and
  program for the creation,\nmanagement, and installation of schema updates (called
  \"migrations\")\nfor a relational database.  In particular, this package lets the\nmigration
  author express explicit dependencies between migrations and\nthe management tool
  automatically installs or reverts migrations\naccordingly, using transactions for
  safety.\n\nThis package operates on two logical entities:\n\n - The \"backend\",
  which is the relational database whose schema you\n   want to manage.\n\n - The
  \"migration store\" (or simply \"store\"), which is the collection\n   of schema
  changes you want to apply to the database.  These\n   migrations are expressed using
  plain text files collected together\n   in a single directory, although the library
  is general enough to\n   permit easy implementation of other storage backends for\n
  \  migrations.\n\nGetting started with dbmigrations\n---------------------------------\n\nThis
  package includes one program, \"moo\". See MOO.TXT for details on how\nto use this
  tool to manage your database migrations.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIf you've
  obtained this package in source form and would like to\ninstall it, you'll need
  the \"cabal\" program. To install this package\nfrom the source directory, run `cabal
  install`.\n\nSubmitting patches\n------------------\n\nI'll gladly consider accepting
  patches to this package; please do not\nhesitate to submit GitHub pull requests.
  I'll be more likely to accept\na patch if you can follow these guidelines where
  appropriate:\n\n  - Keep patches small; a single patch should make a single logical\n
  \   change with minimal scope.\n\n  - If possible, include tests with your patch.\n\n
  \ - If possible, include haddock with your patch.\n"

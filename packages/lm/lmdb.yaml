description: ! 'LMDB is a read-optimized Berkeley DB replacement developed by Symas

  for the OpenLDAP project. LMDB has impressive performance characteristics

  and a friendly BSD-style OpenLDAP license. See <http://symas.com/mdb/>.


  This library has Haskell bindings to the LMDB library. You must install

  the lmdb development files before installing this library,

  e.g. `sudo apt-get install liblmdb-dev` works for Ubuntu 14.04.


  For now, only a low level interface is provided, and the author is moving

  on to use LMDB rather than further develop its bindings. If a higher level

  API is desired, please consider contributing, or develop a separate package.'

description: ! 'A patch is a collection of modifications (edits) to be made to a sequence
  of elements. Commonly

  found in version control systems, patches are also a simple example of a group,
  supporting composition

  and inversion.


  This library provides a pleasant interface for working with patches to vectors with
  any type of element.

  It includes patch composition, inversion, and application, as well as a way to compute
  a patch between

  two vectors using the Wagner-Fischer algorithm.


  It also includes a simple implementation of the Operational Transform (OT) function
  to resolve

  diverging patches from the same document. This allows for reasonably painless implementation
  of merge

  functions, as well as many applications in distributed editing of documents.'

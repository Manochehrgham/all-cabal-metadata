description: ! 'A patch is a collection of modifications (edits) to be made to a sequence
  of elements. Commonly

  found in version control systems, patches are also a simple example of a group,
  supporting composition

  and inversion.


  This library provides a pleasant interface for working with patches to vectors with
  any type of element.

  It includes patch composition, inversion, and application, as well as a way to compute
  a patch between

  two vectors using the Wagner-Fischer algorithm.'

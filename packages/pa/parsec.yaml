description: ! 'Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser

  library.  It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package

  homepage), has extensive libraries, good error messages,

  and is fast.  It is defined as a monad transformer that can be

  stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric in the

  input stream type.'

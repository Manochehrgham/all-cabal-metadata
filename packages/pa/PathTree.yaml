description: ! 'This package contains two modules: "Data.LCRSTree" and "Data.PathTree".

  A ''PathTree'' is a tree used to build unified paths from some node. This

  means being able to merge multiple paths, that may overlap at the root, in

  a sensible way. The module comes with a set of functions to add paths.

  A Left-Children-Right-Siblings tree (''LCRSTree'') is a tree that represents

  a multi-way tree (aka, a Rose Tree) in a binary-tree format. It is the

  underlying implementation of ''PathTree''.

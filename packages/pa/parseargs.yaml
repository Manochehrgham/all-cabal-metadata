description: ! "# parseargs\nCommand-line argument parsing for Haskell programs  \nBart
  Massey <bart@cs.pdx.edu>\n\nThis library provides System.Console.Parseargs, a module
  to\nassist in argument parsing for Haskell stand-alone command\nline programs.\n\nThe
  package provides a Haskell command-line argument\n\"parser\".  You supply a specification
  of the arguments to\nyour command-line program; `parseargs` reads the arguments\nand
  checks that they meet your spec. It then fills in a data\nstructure that captures
  the relevant data, from which parsed\narguments can be extracted as needed. See
  the Haddock\ndocumentation for the gory details.\n\nI have used this code with `ghc`
  6 and 7 on Linux.  It is a\nfairly standard Hackage-ready package, to the extent
  I know\nhow to construct such.\n\nThe 0.1.2 release includes a typeclass for argument
  types for\neasier use.\n\nThe 0.1.3 release includes more uniform and usable error\nhandling.\n\nThe
  various 0.1.3.x point releases include bug fixes and\nvarious extra-minor enhancements.
  See the Git log.\n\nThe 0.1.4 release includes the ability to mix optional and\nrequired
  positional arguments.\n\nThe 0.1.5 release includes the \"soft dash\" option, giving\nthe
  ability to allow positional arguments to begin with a\ndash if possible.\n\nThe
  0.1.5.1 release fixes some warnings and stuff.\n\nThe 0.1.5.2 release fixes some
  missing documentation.\n\nThe 0.2 release cleans up some namespace pollution by\nremoving
  `ArgRecord` and the `args` accessor from the public\nnamespace.  This allows the
  use of the name `args` by the\nuser to describe program arguments.\n\nThis library
  is not what I set out to build.  It definitely\ncould also use some work.  However,
  I use it all the time\nfor writing little programs. I thought others might find
  it\nuseful, and I also have released other code that depends on\nit, so I put it
  out there.\n\nHave fun with it, and let me know if there are problems.\n\nThis code
  is released under a \"3-clause BSD\" license. Please\nsee the file COPYING in this
  distribution for license terms.\n"

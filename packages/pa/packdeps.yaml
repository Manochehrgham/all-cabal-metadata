description: ! 'This provides a library and command line tool for checking if the
  upper bounds in your package''s dependency list excludes the newest package available.
  The code was originally available only as a web interface at <http://packdeps.haskellers.com/>,
  but is now available for standalone use as well.


  The command line tool has an incredibly simple interface: simply pass it a list
  of cabal files, and it will tell you what dependencies- if any- are restricted.'

description: ! 'In distributed, message-oriented applications,

  similar communication patterns are used over and over again,

  such as Server\/Client (a.k.a Request\/Response),

  Publish\/Subscribe,

  Pipline (a.k.a. Push\/Pull) and

  Exclusive Pair (a.k.a. Peer-to-Peer).

  The Patterns package implements those patterns based on zeromq.

  More information on zeromq can be found at

  <http://www.zeromq.org>.

  More examples and a test suite are available

  on <http://github.com/toschoo/mom>.

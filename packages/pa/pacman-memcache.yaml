description: ! 'Read whole Pacman database which pushes it into the memory cache


  Pacman is Linux package manager. It is used by Arch Linux.

  It''s database is rather slow because it contains thousands of little files,

  which takes an enormous time to process.


  The easiest way to speed up operations on database is force all those files into
  memory cache.

  This is the purpose of this program: it reads whole package database,

  where it will reside until kernel decides to remove this files from cache.


  Three subsequent runs of pacman:


  > pacman -Ss foo  0,37s user 0,66s system 2% cpu 41,459 total

  > pacman -Ss foo  0,16s user 0,08s system 98% cpu 0,238 total

  > pacman -Ss foo  0,15s user 0,08s system 97% cpu 0,237 total


  Using pacman-memcache:


  > pacman-memcache  1,11s user 0,53s system 6% cpu 26,312 total

  > pacman -Ss foo  0,15s user 0,09s system 19% cpu 1,260 total

  > pacman -Ss foo  0,15s user 0,08s system 97% cpu 0,235 total

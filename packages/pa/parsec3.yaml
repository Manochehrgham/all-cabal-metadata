description: ! 'Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser

  library.  It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package

  homepage), has extensive libraries and good error messages,

  and is also fast.  It is defined as a monad transformer that can be

  stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric in the

  input stream type.


  This package comes without the compatibility layer for parsec2.


  Note, that the module names overlap with those of newer parsec

  versions, therefore I do not recommend to unconditionally use parsec3

  as dependency in cabal files of packages for hackage.  But you may

  want to develop your code using this subset of parsec3 modules and

  finally change the dependency from parsec3 to parsec in order to

  avoid module ambiguities for users just installing your package.  Your

  own module ambiguities are best avoided by hiding packages.


  This version reflects the changes of parsec-3.1.8'

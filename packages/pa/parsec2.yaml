description: ! 'Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser

  library.  It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package

  homepage), has extensive libraries and good error messages,

  and is also fast.


  This package is a maintained fork of version 2.1 of the parsec

  package, intended to preserve its simplicity and portability.'

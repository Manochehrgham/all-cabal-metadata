  A library to help with compatibility against Parsec versions. Adds an

  instance of `Eq` to the `ParseError` data type, if it''s missing from the

  version of Parsec that you''re compiling against.


  To test Parsec''s parsing, it''s very useful to have an Eq instance for

  ParseError. This is included in Parsec versions >= 3.1.9, but you need

  to define it yourself in previous versions.


  This simple library conditionally adds an Eq instance for ParseError

  only if the Parsec version being used is < 3.1.9. To use it, just add

  parseerror-eq to your cabal dependencies, and in the module where you want

  to compare ParseErrors,


  > import Text.ParseErrorEq ()


  The ParseError Eq instance will be imported if it is necessary, otherwise

  the ParseErrorEq module is empty, so nothing will happen. This ensures that

  your code that needs the ParseError Eq instance will work regardless of the

  Parsec version that it is compiled against.

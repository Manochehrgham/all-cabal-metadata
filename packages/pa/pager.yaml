  =====


  This is a Haskell library to open up the user''s `$PAGER` with some

  text. On Linux, the pager is usually called `less`. On the various

  *BSD''s, the pager is called `more`.


  The pager doesn''t notify people or anything - it takes long output and

  presents it in pages.


  This library is licensed under the FreeBSD license (the 2-clause BSD

  license). Read the LICENSE file for details.

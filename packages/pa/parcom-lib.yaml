description: ! 'Parcom provides parser combinator functionality in a string-type-agnostic
  way;

  it supports strict ByteStrings (with Word8 tokens) and any list type (with

  the element type as the token type) out-of-the-box, including plain old String.

  Any other stream-of-tokens type can be hooked into the library; unlike Parsec,

  none of the built-in parsers assumes char-like tokens.'

description: ! 'Parsimony is a generalized and simplified version of the

  industrial-strength parser combinator library Parsec.

  Like Parsec, it is simple, safe, well documented, convenient,

  with good error messages, and fast.  In addition, Parsimony

  adds support for working with differet types of input such as

  byte strings (for compat input representation) and

  lazy byte strings (for parsing large amounts of data).

  It also supports working with text in different character

  encodings such as UTF8.'

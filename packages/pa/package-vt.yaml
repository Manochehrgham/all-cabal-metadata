description: ! 'This program is meant as a tool for suggesting version change of libraries.

  It tries to match official Package Versioning Policy.


  See <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy> for details.


  This version works by inspecting new/removed exported modules or entities.

  It doesn''t currently check the types of exported elements.


  Typical invocation:


  > package-vt module-ver-1.hs module-ver-2.hs


  If you unpack modules with @cabal unpack@ you can use the following form:


  > # unpack modules

  > cabal unpack package-1

  > cabal unpack package-2

  > package-vt module-1/module.cabal module-2/module.cabal'

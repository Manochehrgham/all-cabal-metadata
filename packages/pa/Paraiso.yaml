description: ! 'The purpose of this project is to design a high-level language

  for implementing explicit partial-differential equations solvers

  on supercomputers as well as todayâ€™s advanced personal

  computers.

  A language to describe the knowledge on algebraic concepts,

  physical equations, integration algorithms, optimization

  techniques, and hardware designs --- all the necessaries of the

  simulations in abstract, modular, re-usable and combinable forms.


  > How to use


  The module "Language.Paraiso.OM.Builder" contains the

  @Builder@ monad, its typeclass instance declarations and

  functions that can be used to build Paraiso

  programs. Reserved words are @load@, @store@, @imm@,

  @loadIndex@, @loadSize@, @shift@, @reduce@ and

  @broadcast@.


  Paraiso frontend uses "Data.Tensor.Typelevel"

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/typelevel-tensor>,

  the library for tensor calculus of

  arbitrary rank and dimension. @Vector@ and @Axis@ are two main

  concepts. The type @Vector@ represents rank-1 tensor, and tensors

  of higher ranks are recursively defined as @Vector@ of

  @Vector@s. With @Axis@ you can refer to the components of

  @Vector@s, compose them, or contract them. See the wiki

  <http://www.paraiso-lang.org/wiki/> and the paper

  <http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4779> for more detail. Examples

  are in <https://github.com/nushio3/Paraiso/tree/master/examples>.


  * 0.3.0.0 /Doughnut/ : refined interface and support for cyclic boundary conditions.


  * 0.2.0.0 /Companion/ : genetic algorithm support for automated tuning.


  * 0.1.0.0 /Binary/ : enhanced backend, code generator for OpenMP and CUDA


  * 0.0.0.0 /Atmosphere/ : code generator for single CPU'

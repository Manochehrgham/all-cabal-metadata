description: ! '@gitlib@ is a high-level, lazy and conduit-aware set of abstractions
  for

  programming with Git types.  Several different backends are available,

  including one for the libgit2 C library (<http://libgit2.github.com>) (see

  @gitlib-libgit2@).  The aim is both type-safety and convenience of use for

  Haskell users, combined with high performance and minimal memory footprint

  by taking advantage of Haskell''s laziness and the conduit library''s

  deterministic resource cleanup.


  For further information, as well as typical use cases, see "Git.Tutorial".'

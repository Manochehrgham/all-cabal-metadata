description: ! "github-backup is a simple tool you run in a git repository you cloned
  from\nGitHub. It backs up everything GitHub publishes about the repository,\nincluding
  branches, tags, other forks, issues, comments, wikis, milestones,\npull requests,
  watchers, and stars.\n\n## Installation\n\n    cabal install github-backup --bindir=$HOME/bin\n\n(Cabal
  is bundled with the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/).)\n\n##
  Use\n\n  Run `github-backup` with no parameters, inside a git repository cloned\n
  \ from GitHub to back up that repository.\n\n  Or, if you have a GitHub account,
  run `github-backup username`\n  to clone and back up your account's repositories,
  as well\n  as the repositories you're watching and have starred.\n\n## Why backup
  GitHub repositories\n\nThere are a couple of reasons to want to back this stuff
  up:\n\n* In case something happens to GitHub. More generally because\n  keeping
  your data in the cloud *and* relying on the cloud to\n  back it up is foolish.\n\n*
  In case someone takes down a repository that you were interested in.\n  If you run
  github-backup with your username, it will back up all \n  the repositories you have
  watched and starred.\n\n* So you can keep working on your repository while on a
  plane, or\n  on a remote beach or mountaintop. Just like Linus intended.\n\n## What
  to expect\n\nEach time you run github-backup, it will find any new forks on GitHub.
  It\nwill add remotes to your repository for the forks, using names like\n`github_torvalds_subsurface`.
  It will fetch from every fork.\n\nIt downloads metadata from each fork. This is
  stored\ninto a branch named \"github\". Each fork gets a directory in there,\nlike
  `torvalds_subsurface`. Inside the directory there will be some\nfiles, like `torvalds_subsurface/watchers`.
  There may be further\ndirectories, like for comments: `torvalds_subsurface/comments/1`.\n\nYou
  can follow the commits to the github branch to see what information\nchanged on
  GitHub over time.\n\nThe format of the files in the github branch is currently Haskell\nserialized
  data types. This is plain text, and readable, if you squint.\n\n## Limitations\n\ngithub-backup
  is repository-focused. It does not try to back up other\ninformation from GitHub.
  In particular, social network stuff, like\nusers who are following you, is not backed
  up.\n\ngithub-backup does not log into GitHub, so it cannot backup private\nrepositories.\n\nNotes
  added to commits and lines of code don't get backed up yet.\nThere is only recently
  API support for this.\n\nThe labels that can be added to issues and milestones are
  not backed up.\nNeither are the hooks. They could be, but don't seem important\nenough
  for the extra work involved. Yell if you need them.\n\ngithub-backup re-downloads
  all issues, comments, and so on\neach time it's run. This may be slow if your repo
  has a lot of them,\nor even if it just has a lot of forks.\n\nBear in mind that
  this uses the GitHub API; don't run it every 5 minutes.\nGitHub [rate limits](http://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting)
  the\nAPI to some small number of requests per hour when used without\nauthentication.
  To avoid this limit, you can set `GITHUB_USER` and\n`GITHUB_PASSWORD` in the environment
  and it will log in when making \n(most) API requests.\n\nAnyway, github-backup *does*
  do an incremental backup, picking up where it\nleft off, so will complete the backup
  eventually even if it's rate limited.\n\n## Author\n\ngithub-backup was written
  by Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>\n\nIt is made possible thanks to:\n\n* Mike Burns's
  [haskell github library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/github)\n* GitHub, for
  providing an API exposing this data. \n"

description: ! 'Gitpeda is a a tool that presents data from your program’s benchmark
  suite

  (or any other source), with nice tables and shiny graphs.


  So it is up to you whether you have a polling shell script loop, a post-commit

  hook or a elaborate jenkins setup. As long as the performance data ends up in

  the `logs/` directory, gipeda is happy.


  Gipeda produces static pages. In fact, the (single) html file and the

  accompagning JavaScript code is completely static. Giepda just generates a

  large number of json files. This has the advantage of easy deployment: Just put

  gipeda in your webspace of copy the files to some static web hosting and you

  are done. This putts very little load on your server, is cache friendly and has

  no security problems.

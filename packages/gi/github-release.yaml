description: ! "# [GitHub Release][]\n\n[![Version badge][]][version]\n[![Build badge][]][build]\n[![Windows
  build badge][]][windows build]\n\nGitHub Release is a command-line utility for uploading
  files to GitHub\nreleases.\n\nThe recommended way to get GitHub Release is to download
  [the latest release][]\nfor your operating system. These releases are, of course,
  added with GitHub\nRelease itself.\n\nOnce you've got it, run it like so:\n\n```
  sh\ngithub-release upload \\\n  --token '...' \\\n  --owner 'someone' \\\n  --repo
  'something' \\\n  --tag '1.2.3' \\\n  --file 'path/to/example.tgz' \\\n  --name
  'example-1.2.3.tgz'\n```\n\nYou can generate a token on the [personal access tokens][]
  page of your\npersonal settings. The `file` option is the path to the local file
  you want to\nupload. The `name` option is what the file should be called on the
  GitHub\nrelease.\n\nGitHub Release is written in Haskell. If you want to build it
  yourself or use\nit in your project, you'll want to get [Stack][]. Once you've done
  that, you\ncan install and use it from the command line.\n\n``` sh\nstack --resolver
  nightly install github-release\nstack exec -- github release upload # as above ...\n```\n\nOr
  you can use it from Haskell.\n\n``` hs\nimport qualified GitHubRelease\nGitHubRelease.upload\n
  \   \"...\"                 -- token\n    \"someone\"             -- owner\n    \"something\"
  \          -- repo\n    \"1.2.3\"               -- tag\n    \"path/to/example.tgz\"
  -- file\n    \"example-1.2.3.tgz\"   -- name\n```\n\nInspired by <https://github.com/aktau/github-release>.\n\n[GitHub

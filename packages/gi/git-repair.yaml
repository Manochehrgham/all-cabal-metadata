description: ! 'git-repair can repair various forms of damage to git repositories.


  It is a complement to git fsck, which finds problems, but does not fix

  them.


  As well as avoiding the need to rm -rf a damaged repository and re-clone,

  using git-repair can help rescue commits you''ve made to the damaged

  repository and not yet pushed out.'

description: ! 'This package provides the ability to manipulate NTFS junction points
  as

  supported by Windows 2000 and above. Junction points, along with NTFS hard

  links and NTFS symbolic links, are a type of symbolic link that can be made

  between folders existing on the same filesystem. Please read Microsoft

  KB205524 [1] for more information on junction points.


  Junction points have always been left undocumented in the Win32 SDK. The

  Windows 2000 Resource Kit came with a command-line utility named linkd.exe

  to work with them. Later, Mark Russinovich of SysInternals distributed a

  replacement utility named Junction [2] which accomplished the same thing.


  This source code is based on an article [3] and C++ library [4] written by

  Mike Nordell at codeproject.com.


  It is against Microsoft''s recommendation to make use of undocumented API

  features. Use this library at your own risk.

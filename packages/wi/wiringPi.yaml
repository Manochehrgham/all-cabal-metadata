synopsis: Access GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi via wiringPi library
changelog: ! "-*- Text -*-\n\n1.0  @  Mon Jan 23 17:51:35 PST 2017\n\n* Initialization
  is now automatic.\n\n* Pin now has three constructors, one for each pin numbering
  scheme.\n  You can now mix pin numbering schemes in a single program, rather\n  than
  having to choose one at initialization time.\n\n0.1  @  Tue Jan 10 21:15:33 UTC
  2017\n\n* Initial release.\n"

description: ! "This is a Haskell binding to the [wiringPi library][1], which allows\nyou
  to interface with the [GPIO][4] pins on the [Raspberry Pi][2].\nUnlike some other
  solutions for using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins,\nwiringPi provides access to more
  advanced features, such as enabling\nthe internal pull-up or pull-down resistors.\n\nTo
  use this library, you must either run as root, or set the\n`WIRINGPI_GPIOMEM` environment
  variable.  (Set it to anything; the\nvalue does not matter.)  However, PWM will
  not work if\n`WIRINGPI_GPIOMEM` is set.\n\nThis library will only build on the Raspberry
  Pi.  Before building\nthis library, you must install the \"wiringPi\" C library
  on your\nRaspberry Pi, like this:\n\n    sudo apt-get install wiringpi\n\nTested
  on a Raspberry Pi Model B, with [Raspbian Jessie Lite][3],\nusing the system-provided
  Haskell compiler.  (GHC 7.6.3.)\n\nThis Haskell binding is licensed under the 3-clause
  BSD license, and\nthe examples in the `examples` directory are in the public domain.\nHowever,
  be aware that the wiringPi C library itself is licensed under\nthe LGPLv3+.\n\n[1]:

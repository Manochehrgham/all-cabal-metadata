description: ! 'This package provides an alternative to the Win32 library''s error
  handling

  mechanism. The goal is to provide a nearly drop-in replacement for Win32''s

  error-handling functions while offering the following benefits:


  * Ability to distinguish between different Win32 error codes.


  * Ability to catch Win32 exceptions separately from other exception types.


  * Ability to query for the generating function''s name and standard system error
  massage associated with the exception.'

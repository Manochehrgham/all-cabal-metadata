description: ! 'A library to provide data types for large (ie > 64 bits) but fixed
  width signed

  and unsigned integers with the usual typeclass instances to allow them to be used

  interchangeably with `Word64`.


  The types and operations are coded to be as fast as possible using strictness

  annotations, `INLINEABLE` pragmas and unboxed values and operations where

  appropriate.'

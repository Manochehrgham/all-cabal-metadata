description: ! 'The cyclotomic numbers are a subset of the

  complex numbers that are represented exactly, enabling exact

  computations and equality comparisons.  They

  contain the Gaussian rationals (complex numbers

  of the form p + q i with p and q rational), as well

  as all complex roots of unity.  The

  cyclotomic numbers contain the square roots of

  all rational numbers.  They contain the sine and

  cosine of all rational multiples of pi.

  The cyclotomic numbers form a field, being closed under

  addition, subtraction, mutiplication, and division.'

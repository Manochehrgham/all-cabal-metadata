description: ! 'txt-sushi is a collection of command line utilities for processing

  comma-separated and tab-delimited files (AKA flat files, spreadsheets).

  The most important utility (tssql) lets you perform SQL selects on CSV files.

  By focusing exclusively on processing text files with a tabular structure,

  TxtSushi simplifies common tasks like filtering, joining and transformation

  that would take more effort to accomplish with a general purpose text

  processing language.'

description: ! 'A cyber-anarchist e-library directory based on FUSE virtual file system.

  It is intended to work with FB2 (FictionBook2) e-book archives in the first

  place. Other e-book formats and archive layouts may be implemented later.


  Today Snusmumrik consists of two utilities, `snus` to index archives and

  `mumrik` to mount library directory at given mount point. Mounted directory

  is organized by author name, by genre and by language.'

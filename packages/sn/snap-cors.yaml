description: ! 'Add CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) headers to Snap applications.
  This

  enables web applications running on other domains to make requests against

  another application.


  Currently this package provides support for setting the

  @Access-Control-Allow-Origin@ and @Access-Control-Allow-Credentials@ headers,

  it does not yet do pre-flighting. If you need this, please open an issue on

  Github and I''ll fix it ASAP (otherwise I will add this feature as time permits).'

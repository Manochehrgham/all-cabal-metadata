description: ! 'This package provides two Snaplets implementing

  typed sessions in the Snap web framework, as either

  memory-backed arbitrary types, or as client-side

  cookie-backed serializable types.  Unlike the

  standard session snaplet, sessions can be of an

  arbitrary type appropriate to the application.

  Client-side session data is encrypted for security,

  and sessions have a configurable timeout (optional

  for the client-side back end).


  In addition, a library is provided for a

  continuation-based programming model called

  Snap Dialogues.  Dialogues allow natural

  specification of stateful interactions with the

  client that span multiple requests.  Because the

  session type is not serializable, this requires the

  memory-backed session implementation.'

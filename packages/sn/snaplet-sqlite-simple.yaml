description: ! 'This snaplet provides support for using the SQLite

  database with a Snap Framework application via the

  sqlite-simple package.  It also includes an

  authentication backend.


  See

  <https://github.com/nurpax/snaplet-sqlite-simple/tree/master/example>

  for an example project that demonstrates the use of

  this snaplet.  It implements a stand-alone application

  with a login screen that persists user information in

  a SQLite database and allows a logged in user to save

  comments.  Querying and listing comments demonstrates

  how a user of snaplet-sqlite-simple might relate

  Snaplet.Auth based AuthUsers to his own tables.'

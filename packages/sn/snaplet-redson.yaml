description: ! 'This snaplet provides HTTP API to /c/reate, /r/ead,

  /u/pdate and /d/elete JSON objects sent by client

  and stored in Redis key-value cache. CRUD methods

  are mapped to HTTP `POST`, `GET`, `PUT` and

  `DELETE`. Valid objects are described using model

  definition syntax, which includes information on

  fields and permissions. The snaplet supports

  role-based user permissions system as implemented

  by Snap authentication. Model definitions may

  also be used by browser JavaScript to provide

  interface to create or edit objects.

  There is a permission-less transparent mode,

  WebSocket create/delete notifications and

  timeline method to serve information about

  recently added objects. Ad-hoc search is

  implemented in Redis and provided via snaplet

  route.

  There''s a "snapless" part of the package, which

  implements Snap-agnostic Redis CRUD operations

  for key-value pair collections and may be used

  for tools which operate with storage directly

  without using web framework.

description: ! 'Sass integration for Snap with request based compilation during development
  and precompilation in production.


  Get started by reading through the <https://github.com/lukerandall/snaplet-sass
  README>.


  = Brief overview


  Add the snaplet to your App in Application.hs


  > import Snap.Snaplet.Sass

  >

  > data App = App [

  >     _sass :: Snaplet Sass

  >     ] -- these should be curly braces but haddock doesn''t allow it


  In Site.hs, add a route for sass to serve from and initialize the snaplet


  > routes = [..., ("/sass", with sass sassServe)]

  >

  > app :: SnapletInit App App

  > app = makeSnaplet "app" "A snaplet example application." Nothing $ do

  >   s <- nestSnaplet "sass" sass initSass

  > return $ App s


  Now add your Sass files to snaplets\/sass\/src and they''ll be served

  at \/sass\//FILE/.css. Take note that the .sass or .scss extension will

  be replaced with .css.

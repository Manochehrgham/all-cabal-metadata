description: ! 'S-Cargot is a library for working with s-expressions in

  a modular and extensible way, opting for genericity and

  flexibility instead of speed. Instead of understanding

  one particular form of s-expression, the S-Cargot library

  exposes tools for parsing or emitting different kinds of

  s-expressions, including features not normally included

  in an s-expression library like reader macros or tight

  control over indentation in pretty-printing.'

description: ! 'This library contains a definition of generalized lenses that are
  built

  on top of the @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fclabels fclabels>@ package.


  It also contains SOP-style generic functions (based on the

  @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop generics-sop>@ package) that

  compute lenses for a given record type. Generalized lenses for the

  SOP representation types are also provided.


  Furthermore, a generic function is provided that computes a lens from

  a given (string-based) path specification.

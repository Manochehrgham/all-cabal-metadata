description: ! 'The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative technique that

  finds a local minimum of a function that is expressed as the sum of

  squares of nonlinear functions. It has become a standard technique

  for nonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of as a

  combination of steepest descent and the Gauss-Newton method. When

  the current solution is far from the correct one, the algorithm

  behaves like a steepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to

  converge. When the current solution is close to the correct

  solution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.


  Optional box- and linear constraints can be given. Both single and

  double precision floating point types are supported.


  The actual algorithm is implemented in a

  <http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/ C library> which is

  bundled with @bindings-levmar@ which this package depends on.


  A note regarding the license:


  This library depends on @bindings-levmar@ which is bundled together

  with a C library which falls under the GPL. Please be aware of this

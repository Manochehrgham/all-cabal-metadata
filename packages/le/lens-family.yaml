synopsis: Lens Families
changelog: ! '1.2.1 (Changes from 1.2.0)

  =========================

  * Bump dependency on transformers and mtl


  1.2.0 (Changes from 1.1.0)

  =========================

  * Corrected associativity of ^. ^.. and ^? from right to left.


  1.1.0 (Changes from 1.0.1)

  =========================

  * Some type synonym definitions have been altered, but should be equivalent.

  * Removed Getting and Setting functors and instead use the equivalent standard functors
  Const and Identity.

  * Renamed Setter to ASetter and generalized Setters to be a LensLike constrained
  to an "Identical" functor.

  * Added the (<~) operator.

  * Corrected the definition of ATraversal''


  1.0.1 (Changes from 1.0.0)

  =========================

  * Bump dependency on transformers and mtl


  1.0.0 (Changes from 0.1.0)

  =========================

  * added support for folds and traversals

  * renamed all functions to be mostly compatible with the lexicon from lens.


  0.1.0 (Changes from 0.0.1)

  =========================

  * added project and sec

  * added <>= and <>~

  * renamed functional modifier operators

  * moving setting to Lens.Family2.Unchecked because one needs to verify the functor
  laws


  0.0.1 (Changes from 0.0.0)

  =========================

  * Bump dependency on containers

  * Fixed dependency on mtl

description: ! 'This package provides first class functional references.

  In addition to the usual operations of getting, setting and composition, plus integration
  with monad state, lens families provide some unique features:


  * Polymorphic updating


  * Traversals


  * Cast projection functions to read-only lenses


  * Cast \"toList\" functions to read-only traversals


  * Cast semantic editor combinators to modify-only traversals.'

description: ! 'This package provides first class(†) functional references.

  In addition to the usual operations of getting, setting and composition, plus integration
  with the state monad, lens families provide some unique features:


  * Polymorphic updating


  * Traversals


  * Cast projection functions to read-only lenses


  * Cast \"toList\" functions to read-only traversals


  * Cast semantic editor combinators to modify-only traversals.


  (†) For optimal first-class support use the @lens-family@ package with rank 2 /
  rank N polymorphism.

  "Lens.Family.Clone" allows for first-class support of lenses and traversals for
  those who require Haskell 98.'

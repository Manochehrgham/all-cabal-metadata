description: ! 'From <http://leveldb.googlecode.com>:


  LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides

  an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.



  This library provides a Haskell language binding to LeveldDB. It is in very

  early stage and has seen very limited testing.


  Note: as of v1.3, LevelDB can be built as a shared library. Thus, as of

  v0.1.0 of this library, LevelDB is no longer bundled and must be installed

  on the target system (version 1.7 or greater is required).'

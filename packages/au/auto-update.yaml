description: ! '## auto-update


  A common problem is the desire to have an action run at a scheduled interval,

  but only if it is needed. For example, instead of having every web request

  result in a new `getCurrentTime` call, we''d like to have a single worker thread

  run every second, updating an `IORef`. However, if the request frequency is

  less than once per second, this is a pessimization, and worse, kills idle GC.


  This library allows you to define actions which will either be performed by a

  dedicated thread or, in times of low volume, will be executed by the calling

  thread.

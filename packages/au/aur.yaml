description: ! 'Access package information from Arch Linux''s AUR via its

  RPC interface. The main exposed functions reflect

  those of the RPC:


  * info:      Get metadata for one package.


  * multiinfo: Get metadata for many packages at once.


  * search:    Get limited metadata for packages that

  match a given regex.


  * msearch:   Get metadata for all packages maintained

  by a given user.


  By default this library supports version 3 of the RPC,

  and hence version 3.2+ of the AUR.'

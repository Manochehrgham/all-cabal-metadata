description: ! 'This Haskell package provides a data structure of sets that are indexed

  by potentially multiple indices.


  Sets can be created, modified, and queried in various ways.


  The package is a variant of the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ixset ixset>

  package. The ixset package makes use

  of run-time type information to find a suitable index on a query, resulting

  in possible run-time errors when no suitable index exists. In ixset-typed,

  the types of all indices available or tracked in the type system.

  Thus, ixset-typed should be safer to use than ixset, but in turn requires

  more GHC extensions.


  At the moment, the two packages are relatively compatible. As a consequence

  of the more precise types, a few manual tweaks are necessary when switching

  from one to the other, but the interface is mostly the same.'

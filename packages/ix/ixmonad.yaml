description: Provides the 'parametric effect monad' structure to Haskell with a number
  of analogous of familiar monads (Reader, Writer, State, Maybe, Ticks) and a wrapper
  over normal monads (Control.Effect.Monad). This provides a way to embed effect systems
  into Haskell. For more information see <http://dorchard.co.uk/ixmonad> and the examples
  in <https://github.com/dorchard/effect-monad/tree/master/examples>.

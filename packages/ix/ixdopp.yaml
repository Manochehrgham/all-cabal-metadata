description: ! 'This preprocessor expands a Haskell program using "ixdo" notation

  into a Haskell program using the indexed monad bind operator

  (>>>=).  It also serves as an example for the preprocessor-tools

  package.


  While GHC 6.10 can now expand do-notation when (>>=) is rebound

  at a non-standard type, this makes it difficult to use

  do-notation for both monads and custom monad-like structures in

  the same compilation module.  This preprocessor makes it easy to

  use do-like syntax for indexed monads while retaining "do" for

  monads.


  If installed in ~/.cabal, then ~/.cabal/bin must be in the path

  for GHC to find it from a -pgmF flag.'

description: ! 'The Xorshift random generator is a very fast generator that uses

  only XOR and bitshifting operations. This package contains a basic version

  with a periode of 2^32-1 for 32-bit numbers and a version with a periode of

  2^64-1 for 64-bit numbers.


  Although the author didn''t tested the random generator,

  but according to it''s specification the resulting numbers are of good

  quality.'

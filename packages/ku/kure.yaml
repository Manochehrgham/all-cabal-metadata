description: ! 'The Kansas University Rewrite Engine (KURE) is a domain-specific language
  for strategic rewriting.

  KURE was inspired by Stratego and StrategyLib, and has similarities with Scrap Your
  Boilerplate and Uniplate.


  The basic transformation functionality can be found in "Language.KURE.Transform",

  and the traversal functionality can be found in "Language.KURE.Walker".

  Several basic examples of using KURE are provided in the source-code bundle.

  For larger examples, see the HERMIT or HTML-KURE packages.


  You can read about KURE in the following article:


  The Kansas University Rewrite Engine: A Haskell-Embedded Strategic Programming Language
  with Custom Closed Universes.  Neil Sculthorpe, Nicolas Frisby and Andy Gill.  Journal
  of Functional Programming.  Cambridge University Press, 24(4), pages 434-473, 2014.

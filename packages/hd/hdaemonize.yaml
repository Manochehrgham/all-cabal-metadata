description: ! 'Provides two functions that help writing better UNIX daemons,

  daemonize and serviced: daemonize does what a daemon should do

  (forking and closing descriptors), while serviced does that and

  more (syslog interface, PID file writing, start-stop-restart

  command line handling, dropping privileges).'

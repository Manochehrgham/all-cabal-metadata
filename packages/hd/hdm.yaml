description: A small display manager which loads from shell and just provides a text
  based menu for selecting the xinitrc file of your choice.  I created it for use
  with xmonad, where I often wish to start up gnome or xfce4 as well.  Since this
  uses startx, it handles multiple xsessions seamlessly.

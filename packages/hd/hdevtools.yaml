description: ! '''hdevtools'' is a backend for text editor plugins, to allow for things
  such as

  syntax and type checking of Haskell code, and retrieving type information, all

  directly from within your text editor.


  The advantage that ''hdevtools'' has over competitors, is that it runs silently

  in a persistent background process, and therefore is able to keeps all of your

  Haskell modules and dependent libraries loaded in memory. This way, when you

  change only a single source file, only it needs to be reloaded and rechecked,

  instead of having to reload everything.


  This makes ''hdevtools'' very fast for checking syntax and type errors (runs just

  as fast as the '':reload'' command in GHCi).


  In fact, syntax and type checking is so fast, that you can safely enable auto

  checking on every save. Even for huge projects, checking is nearly instant.


  Once you start using ''hdevtools'' and you get used to having your errors shown

  to you instantly (without having to switch back and forth between GHCi and your

  editor), and shown directly on your code, in your editor (without having to

  wait forever for GHC to run) you will wonder how you ever lived without it.


  In addition to checking Haskell source code for errors, ''hdevtools'' has tools

  for getting info about identifiers, and getting type information for snippets

  of code.'

description: ! 'For web applications running in a CGI monad container, this module

  provides a simple interface to generate HTTP Digest authentication

  challenges and to process the responses from clients. It implements

  RFC2617, but accepts the quirky responses generated by some

  non-compliant browsers.


  This module was originally implemented for Serialist

  (<http://serialist.net>) and is deployed there in a FastCGI

  environment using the fastcgi package. It has been tested against a

  variety of browsers, including Firefox, Safari, IE, Opera, and others.'

  Documentation: [foundation on hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/foundation)


  Goals

  =====


  * provide a base like set of modules that provide a consistent set of features and
  bugfixes across multiple versions of GHC (unlike base).

  * provide a better and more efficient prelude than base''s prelude.

  * be self-sufficient: no external dependencies apart from base (or ghc packages).

  * provide better data-types: packed unicode string by default, arrays.

  * Better numerical classes that better represent mathematical things (No more all-in-one
  Num).


  How to use

  ==========


  Disable the built-in prelude at the top of your file:


  ```haskell

  {-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}

  ```


  Or directly in your project cabal file:


  ```haskell

  Default-Extensions: NoImplicitPrelude

  ```


  Then in your modules:


  ```haskell

  import Foundation

  ```


  How to contribute

  =================


  Any contributions is welcome, but a short list includes:


  * Improve the code base

  * Report an issue

  * Fix an issue

  * Improve the documentation

  * Make tutorial on how to use foundation

  * Make your project use foundation instead of base, report the missing coverage
  (IO, types, etc.), or what functionality is missing to make a succesful transition



  Design

  ======


  Foundation started on the simple idea of trying to put everything I need in one

  simple and consistent package. The amazing haskell ecosystem is extremely

  fragmented and maintained by different people with different goals, free time,

  and style. The overall scare of not trying to change anything relatively

  central (base, bytestring, text, vector ..) for a promise of stability has pushed

  many people to work on their own thing, leading to unnecessary work duplication

  and further fragmentation.



  Foundation uses and abuses type families.

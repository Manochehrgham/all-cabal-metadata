description: ! 'Focuses are lists of numbers where longer lists are treated as

  ''focuses'' on their parent lists. As such, `Focus []` is

  considered "unfocused" (it is EQ to all focuses), `Focus [1, 1]`

  is EQ to `Focus [1, 1, 3]` because their roots are equal, and so

  on. This isn''t useful for testing true equality, but it is quite

  useful for traversing and pruning indexed rose trees from one

  locus to another.'

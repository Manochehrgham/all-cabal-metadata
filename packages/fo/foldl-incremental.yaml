description: ! 'Incremental statistical folds based upon the

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foldl foldl> libray.  An incremental statistical
  fold can be thought of as

  exponentially-weighting statistics designed to be efficient computations over

  a Foldable.

  It supplies "incrementalize" which turns any unary function into a

  "Fold".  As a reference, `incrementalize id` is an exponentially-weighted moving
  average.'

description: ! 'The ForSyDe (Formal System Design) methodology has been developed
  with the objective to move system design to a higher level of abstraction and to
  bridge the abstraction gap by transformational design refinement.

  This library provides ForSyDe''s implementation as a Haskell-embedded Domain Specific
  Language (DSL). For more information, please see ForSyDe''s website: <http://www.ict.kth.se/forsyde/>.

  This will be most probably the last update on this package. It will be splitted
  to ForSyDe-shallow and ForSyDe-deep in the next release.'

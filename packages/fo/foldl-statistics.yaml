description: ! 'The use of this package allows statistics to be computed using at
  most two

  passes over the input data, one to compute a mean and one to compute a further

  statistic such as variance and /n/th central moments. All algorithms are the

  obvious implementation of Bryan O\''Sullivan\''s

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/statistics statistics> package imeplemented

  as `Fold''s from the

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foldl foldl> package.'

description: ! '# forest-fire


  This is a little command-line tool with an ill-advised name, to easily

  tear down CloudFormation stacks which have outputs that other stacks

  depend on.  In the AWS Console this is rather annoying, since you have

  to manually chase up dependencies.


  This tool simply interrogates the `aws-cli` tool about the stack

  you''re trying to delete, finds out its outputs, and checks whether any

  currently-active stacks are importing them.  The output is a

  dependency tree, which trivially tells us the order of deletion for it

  to succeed.  If you''re feeling adventurous, you may also let

  `forest-fire` do the actual deletion for you.


  # Installation


  ## Prerequisites


  You''ll need the following installed and available to be able to use

  this software:


  ### [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)


  You''ll want to install Stack using your local package manager (yes,

  it''s available on Homebrew as `haskell-stack`), or if you''re

  adventurous, using their `curl | bash` method...


  You''ll need to add `~/.local/bin` to your `$PATH`.


  ### AWS CLI interface


  I''m guessing that this is a thing you''ll already have.


  ## Instructions


  To download and install the utility, simply run:


  ```sh

  stack install forest-fire

  ```


  # Usage


  If you simply run the tool without arguments, it''ll print usage

  information.  Here''s the down-low, however.


  ## Find out what depends on a stack


  Note that this performs a **dry run** (read-only).  The dependency

  tree will be printed, along with the order in which you''d have to

  perform deletions, but nothing will be executed.


  ```sh

  forest-fire "kubernetes-dynamic-91acf0ef-lifecycle"

  ```


  ## Perform the deletions if you''re satisfied with the tree


  ```sh

  forest-fire "kubernetes-dynamic-91acf0ef-lifecycle" --delete

  ```

  Thanks Redbubble, i totally should''ve been doing other things instead

  of shaving this yak.

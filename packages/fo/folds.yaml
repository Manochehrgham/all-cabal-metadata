description: ! 'This package is a playground full of comonadic folds.


  This style of fold is documented in <https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/edwardk/cellular-automata/part-2
  "Cellular Automata, Part II: PNGs and Moore">


  This package can be seen as what happens if you chase Max Rabkin''s <http://squing.blogspot.com/2008/11/beautiful-folding.html
  "Beautiful Folding"> to its logical conclusion.


  More information on this approach can be found in the <http://conal.net/blog/posts/another-lovely-example-of-type-class-morphisms

description: ! 'Basic4x6 font for OpenGL containing digits and symbols. It is

  called \"4x6\" because it was drawn in 4x6 grids on graph paper.


  This library might not be a good idea, but I needed to display

  some simple values and didn''t want to introduce any heavy

  dependencies.


  Run executable ''show-font-basic4x6'' for a demo.'

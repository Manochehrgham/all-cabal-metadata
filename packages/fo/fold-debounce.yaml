synopsis: Fold multiple events that happen in a given period of time.
changelog: ! "# Revision history for fold-debounce\n\n## 0.2.0.0  -- 2015-06-01\n\n*
  The debounce period now starts from the time when the first input\n  event is sent.
  Previously it was the time when the first input event\n  is popped from the input
  queue. That lead to weird behavior when the\n  input traffic was too intense.\n\n*
  Now this module works without -threaded ghc option thanks to new\n  dependency on
  'stm-delay' package.\n\n* Bumped the major version due to the new dependency.\n\n\n##
  0.1.0.0  -- 2015-05-22\n\n* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world.\n"

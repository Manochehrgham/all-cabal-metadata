  the support for magic braces.

  For example an empty pair of braces will be replaced to file name, with \"100\"
  inside it will be replaced to 100, 101, 102... for each file, and with \"s\/bmp$\/jpg\"
  inside it will invoke a sed command on the file names to change ext name from bmp
  to jpg.'

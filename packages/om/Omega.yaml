description: ! 'Sets of integer tuples and relations on integer tuples.

  Sets and relations are represented compactly by storing their

  characteristic function as a Presburger arithmetic formula.

  Formulae are simplified and solved by the Omega Library.

  The primary interface can be found in

  "Data.Presburger.Omega.Set" and "Data.Presburger.Omega.Rel".'

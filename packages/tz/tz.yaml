description: ! 'The goal of this package is to provide a library that can read time

  zone info files (aka. Olson files), and does time zone conversions

  in a /pure/ and /efficient/ way.


  We also provide platform-independent and/or compiled-in access to

  the standard Time Zone Dabase by the means of the companion @tzdata@

  package <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tzdata>.


  The package is currently in a draft phase, I''m still experimenting

  with different ideas wrt. scope\/API\/implementation\/etc. All

  comments are welcome!'

description: ! 'The goal of this package is to distribute the standard Time Zone

  Database in a cabal package, so that it can be used in Haskell

  programs uniformly on all platforms.


  This package currently ships the @2015a@ version of the time zone

  database.  The version of the time zone database shipped is always

  reflected in the version of this package: @x.y.YYYYMMDD.z@, then

  @YYYYMMDD@ is the official release date of time zone database.


  See: <http://www.iana.org/time-zones> for more info about the time

  zone database.


  See also the @tz@ package <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tz> or

  the @timezone-olson@ and @timezone-series@ packages that provide

  facilities to /use/ the data shipped here. (The @tz@ package

  automatically installs this package.)'

description: ! 'A MediaWiki''s RecentChanges or NewPages links to every new edit or
  article; this bot will

  poll the corresponding RSS feeds (easier and more reliable than parsing the HTML),
  follow

  the links to the new edit/article, and then use TagSoup to filter out every off-wiki
  link

  (eg. to http://cnn.com).


  With this list of external links, the bot will then fire off requests to http://webcitation.org/,

  which will make a backup (similar to the Internet Archive, but on-demand).


  Example: to archive links from every article in the English Wikipedia''s RecentChanges:


  > wp-archivebot gwern0@gmail.com ''http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&feed=rss''

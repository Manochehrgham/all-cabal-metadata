description: ! "[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/JohnLato/word24.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/JohnLato/word24)\n\nThis
  library implements 24-bit word and int types suitable for use in vector\nprocessing.\n\nStorable
  implementations are provided, however as they use a size and alignment\nof 3 bytes
  care should be taken to ensure they are compatible if used in\nconjunction with
  the FFI.\n\nThese types use unboxed data and GHC primitives, and are unlikely to
  be\ncompatible with other Haskell compilers.\n\nINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThis
  library uses the Hackage/Cabal build system.  You will need a working\nHaskell compiler
  and appropriate build system.  This is most easily met\nby installing the Haskell
  Platform.  The following command will install\nthe library:\n\ncabal install iteratee\n\nThis
  library is pure Haskell, and should install on any system with a suitable\nHaskell
  compiler with no extra steps required.  In particular, POSIX-compatible,\nMac OSX,
  and Windows should all be supported.\n\nINSTALLATION OPTIONS:\n\nThis library supports
  the following cabal flags:\n  splitBase (default enabled): use the split-up base
  package.\n\n"

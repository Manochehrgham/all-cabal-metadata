synopsis: A library for word-wrapping
changelog: ! "\n0.3.3\n=====\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed accidental breaking of long tokens
  when they could be wrapped\n   instead.\n\n0.3.2\n=====\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed
  a bug that prevented wrapping sometimes.\n\n0.3.1\n=====\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fix inconsistent
  long token breaking (long tokens anywhere but the\n   beginning of a line)\n\n0.3\n===\n\nAPI
  changes:\n * Added the breakLongWords setting to WrapSettings. This setting makes\n
  \  it possible to cause words to get broken up over multiple lines if\n   their
  lengths exceed the wrapping width.\n\n0.2\n===\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added a WrapSettings
  data type for controlling wrapping behavior.\n * All functions now require a WrapSettings.\n
  * Added defaultWrapSettings for prior behavior.\n * Wrap settings now include a
  setting to control how indentation is\n   preserved in broken lines.\n\nBug fixes:\n
  * Lines with only whitespace are preserved as empty lines.\n\n0.1.2\n=====\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * Fixed a bug where multiple consecutive newlines were not properly preserved\n
  \  as advertised (#2)\n\n0.1.1\n=====\n\nPackage changes:\n * Removed a duplicate
  mention of the changelog file in the cabal\n   package description that used the
  wrong filename case (#1)\n\n0.1\n===\n\n* First version.\n"

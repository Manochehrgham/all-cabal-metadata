description: ! 'A program and library to a send WoL Magic Packet, to

  remotely start a computer.


  This program is useful if you have a computer that you

  keep at a friend''s house because he has a fast internet

  connection. But he keeps turning the machine off, saying

  that it warms up his room and your not using it anyway.

  But now you need a way to turn the machine back on...


  Usage:


  > $ wol hostname macaddress [portnumber]


  If the hostname is not statically known, you can try using

  LAN broadcast (@255.255.255.255@).'

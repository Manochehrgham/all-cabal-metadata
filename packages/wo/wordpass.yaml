description: ! 'This script reads dict word lists and generates word-based passwords.

  Not unlike <http://xkcd.com/936/ Xkcd>.


  Program also prints how many words have been read, and indicates estimated

  password space size in bits.


  Using just four words from default English dictionary of ~50k words will

  give approximately 90 bits of entropy. Lucky speakers of languages with

  rich inflection like Polish (over 3 million words) can easily up this to

  over 110 bits of entropy.'

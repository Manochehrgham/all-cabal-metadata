  Dictionary-based password generator.


  [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/mgajda/wordpass.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mgajda/wordpass)

  [![Hackage](https://budueba.com/hackage/wordpass)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wordpass)


  Script reads dict word lists and generates word-based passwords.

  Uses dictionaries from /usr/share/dict by default.

  Inspired by [Xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/936/).


  Program also prints how many words have been read, and indicates estimated

  password space size in bits.


  Using just four words from default English dictionary of ~50k words will

  give approximately 90 bits of entropy. Lucky speakers of languages with

  rich inflection like Polish (over 3 million word variants) can easily up

  this to over 110 bits of entropy.

description: ! 'The package name /loc/ stands for “location” and is also an allusion
  to the

  acronym for “lines of code”.


  The @Loc@ type represents a caret position in a text file, the @Span@ type

  is a nonempty range between two @Loc@s, and the @Area@ type is a set of

  non-touching @Span@s.'

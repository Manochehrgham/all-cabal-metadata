synopsis: A mtl-style monad transformer for general purpose & compositional logging
changelog: ! "# 1.1.2\n\n## Other changes\n\n- Increased upper bound of `time`\n\n#
  1.1.1\n\n- `withBatchedHandler` no longer prints empty log messages. Previously,\n
  \ if you ran a program that didn't log but used `withBatchedHandler` (or anything\n
  \ that used that), an empty log message would be output. Thanks to @codedmart\n
  \ for fixing this.\n\n# 1.1.0\n\n*Breaking changes*:\n\n- `MonadLog` no longer has
  `logMessage` as a function. It now has\n  `logMessageFree` which takes a free monoid
  of log messages. If you were just\n  using `logging-effect` then this won't affect
  you, as `logMessage` still exists\n  with the same signature outside the type class.\n\n-
  `MonadLog` now comes with a law that states that logging is a monoid\n  homomorphism.
  This essentially means that you have to treat all log messages\n  uniformly.\n\n-
  Pass-through instances for all \"stock\" monad transformers have been added\n  (all
  of `transformers`, `CatchT` from exceptions and `FreeT`/`FT` from `free`).\n\n-
  `WithSeverity` now has instances of `Traversable` and `Foldable`\n\n- `WithTimestamp`
  now has instances of `Eq`, `Ord`, `Read` and `Show`.\n\n*Additions*:\n\n- A set
  of convenience functions have been added for quickly logging with\n  severity. The
  combinators are: `logDebug`, `logInfo`, `logNotice`,\n  `logWarning`, `logError`,
  `logCritical`, `logAlert` and `logEmergency`.\n\n- `mapLogMessage` got a companion
  function `mapLogMessageM` that works with \n  monadic tranformations.\n\n*Other*\n\n-
  Many documentation bug fixes.\n\n- INLINEABLE pragmas added.\n\n# 1.0.0\n\n- Initial
  release\n"

description: ! "Overview of key modules, roughly from highest- to lowest-level:\n\n*
  Cyc.hs, which defines an interface for using cyclotomic fields, \n  rings R, and
  quotient rings Rq=R/qR; as well as many other\n  commonly used operations, e.g.,
  converting\n  between rings, decoding and decomposing elements, modulus\n  reduction/rounding,
  etc. etc. Cyc is a safe wrapper around the\n  UCyc type, which exposes some representation-dependent
  operations.\n  UCyc (and hence Cyc) is implemented using a generic Tensor (described
  below).\n\n* Tensor.hs, which defines a class that encapsulates all the necessary\n
  \ linear transformations for operating on representations of R- and\n  Rq-elements,
  e.g., the CRT transform, converting between the\n  powerful and decoding bases,
  generating error terms, etc.\n\n* RepaTensor.hs, which gives an\n  implementation
  of the Tensor class based on the \"repa\"\n  package, a highly optimized and parallelizable
  array library.\n\n* CTensor.hs, which gives an\n  implementation of the Tensor class
  using a C backend via Haskell's FFI.\n\n* FiniteField.hs, which gives an unoptimized
  implementation of finite\n  field arithmetic. To use this module, you will need
  an instance of\n  IrreduciblePoly.  These instances provide irreducible polynomials\n
  \ for various degrees and base fields.  One instance is provided for\n  characteristic
  2 fields of size up to 2^32 in IrreducibleChar2.hs.\n\n* ZqBasic.hs, which is a
  basic implementation of Zq=Z/qZ arithmetic.\n\n* Factored.hs, which contains support
  code for \"reifying\"\n  runtime-chosen integers as static types (mainly, the types
  q and m\n  that are floating around as parameters of many other data types),\n  and
  \"reflecting\" those types as integers back to the code.\n"

description: ! 'Package to support Propositional and First Order Logic.  It includes
  classes

  representing the different types of formulas and terms, some instances of

  those classes for types used in other logic libraries, and implementations of

  several logic algorithms, including conversion to normal form and a simple

  resolution-based theorem prover for any instance of FirstOrderFormula.'

description: ! 'Translate between binary data and a human-readable

  collection of words.


  The PGP Word List consists of two phonetic alphabets, each

  with one word per possible byte value. A string of bytes

  is translated with these alphabets, alternating between

  them at each byte.


  The PGP words corresponding to the bytes @5B 1D CA 6E@

  are "erase breakaway spellbind headwaters", for example.

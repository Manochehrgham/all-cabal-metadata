description: ! 'This is a machine vision package that wraps some functionality

  of OpenCV library. This package has been developed for personal use and

  is not meant to be a complete wrapper. It also includes some things not

  in OpenCV.


  Currently this package is quite dirty and requires much work on documentation

  and code clean-up, but is somewhat tested.


  (The scarce) Documentation is available at

  <http://aleator.github.com/CV/>


  Changelog.

  0.3.6.0 - Critical referential transparency bug fix.


  0.3.5.4 - Bug fixes and preliminary compatability with opencv 2.4


  0.3.5 - Many new wrappers, clean ups and other fixes.


  0.3.4 - Pixelwise operations, bug fixes and additional documentation


  0.3.3.0 - Improvements, including compatablity with opencv 2.3.1 and removal of

  dependency with deprecated JYU.Utils


  Changelog.

  0.3.2.0 - Improvements, including fancier pixel-wise manipulations


  Changelog.

  0.3.0.2 - Workaround for compiling with OS X 10.6 & fixed errors about M_PI

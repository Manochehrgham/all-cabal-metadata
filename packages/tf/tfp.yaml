description: ! 'TFP is an abbreviation for Type Family Programming.

  It provides implementations of type-level integers and booleans,

  and (eventually) simple type-level data structures.

  It uses type families as functions to produce new types,

  which provides an intuitive way to parameterize data types

  and functions on numerical values at compile time.'

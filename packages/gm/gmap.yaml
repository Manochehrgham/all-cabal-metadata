description: ! 'Provides typeclass for and several implementations of composable maps
  and generic tries.

  OrdMap is roughly equivalent to Data.Map .

  ListMap, EitherMap, MaybeMap, TupleMap and EnumMap allow you to break down the corresponding
  types.

  InjectKeys is the easiest way to define tries on your own types, see EitherMap for
  a simple example.

  ChoiceMap and TupleMap correspond to sum and product types, respectively.

  The type-level syntax for creating maps is currently unwieldy. This will improve
  significantly in the next version.'

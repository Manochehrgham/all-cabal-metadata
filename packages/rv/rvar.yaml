description: ! 'Random number generation based on modeling random

  variables by an abstract type (''RVar'') which can be

  composed and manipulated monadically and sampled in

  either monadic or \"pure\" styles.


  The primary purpose of this library is to support

  defining and sampling a wide variety of high quality

  random variables.  Quality is prioritized over speed,

  but performance is an important goal too.


  In my testing, I have found it capable of speed

  comparable to other Haskell libraries, but still

  a fair bit slower than straight C implementations of

  the same algorithms.


  Changes in 0.2.0.1:  Version bump for transformers

  dependency.'

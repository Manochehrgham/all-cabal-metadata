description: ! '## yesod-eventsource


  It''s easy to send an event from an HTTP client to a server:

  just send an HTTP request.  However, sending events from the

  server to the client requires more sophisticated approaches.

  [Server-sent events](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) are a

  standardized way of pushing events from the server to the

  client.


  This package allows your Yesod application to easily send

  server-sent events.  On the client side, you may use the

  `EventSource` JavaScript object on browsers that support it

  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/EventSource)

  or a polyfill for browsers that don''t (we support Remy''s

  polyfill out-of-the-box, although that requires you to

  explicitly support it).

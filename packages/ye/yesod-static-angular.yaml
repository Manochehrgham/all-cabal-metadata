description: ! 'yesod-static supports generators which run at compile time which create
  static

  resources to embed directly into the executable.  This package leverages this to

  provide automatic management of <http://angularjs.org/ AngularJS> code.  During

  development individual files served and reloaded on every request.  When compiling

  for production, the files are minimized, compressed, and then embedded into the

  executable.'

description: ! 'This package is the Yesod.Auth.HashDB plugin, originally included
  as part

  of yesod-auth, but now modified to be more secure and placed in a separate

  package.


  It provides authentication using hashed passwords stored in a database,

  and works best in situations where an administrator is involved in

  setting up a user with an initial password.


  The complete login process, including a default form, is implemented by

  this plugin, but the application developer must design the interfaces

  for setting up users and allowing them to change their own passwords,

  since only the low-level password-setting functions are provided by this

  package.  (Note that other authentication plugins may be more appropriate

  if you wish to use email verification to set up accounts).'

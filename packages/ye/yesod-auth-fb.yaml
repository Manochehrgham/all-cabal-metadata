description: ! 'This package allows you to use Yesod''s authentication framework

  with Facebook as your backend.  That is, your site''s users will

  log in to your site through Facebook.  Your application need to

  be registered on Facebook.


  This package works with both the server-side authentication

  flow

  (<https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/server-side/>)

  via the "Yesod.Auth.Facebook.ServerSide" module and the

  client-side authentication

  (<https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/client-side/>)

  via the "Yesod.Auth.Facebook.ClientSide" module.  It''s up to

  you to decide which one to use.  The server-side code is older

  and as such has been through a lot more testing than the

  client-side code.  Also, for now only the server-side code is

  able to work with other authentication plugins.  The

  client-side code, however, allows you to use some features that

  are available only to the Facebook JS SDK (such as

  automatically logging your users in, see

  <https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/05/08/how-to--improve-the-experience-for-returning-users/>).'

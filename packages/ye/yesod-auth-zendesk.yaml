description: ! 'This package allows users of your website to login into Zendesk

  automatically using Zendesk''s remote authentication

  (<http://www.zendesk.com/support/api/remote-authentication>).


  Note that this is an unusual @yesod-auth-*@ package.  We do not

  define an @AuthPlugin@ because the user can''t log in to your

  website via Zendesk (it''s the opposite, they login in Zendesk

  via your website).  Instead, this plugin defines an Yesod

  subsite that you may include on your site; the subsite defines

  a route that accepts incoming users from Zendesk and

  authenticates them.'

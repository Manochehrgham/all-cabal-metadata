description: ! 'This package allows users of your website to login into

  Desk.com automatically using Desk.com''s Multipass SSO (single

  sign-on, <http://dev.desk.com/docs/portal/multipass>).


  Note that this is an unusual @yesod-auth-*@ package.  We do not

  define an @AuthPlugin@ because the user can''t log in to your

  website via Desk.com (it''s the opposite, they login in Desk.com

  via your website).  Instead, this plugin defines an Yesod

  subsite that you may include on your site; the subsite defines

  a route that accepts incoming users from Desk.com and

  authenticates them.'

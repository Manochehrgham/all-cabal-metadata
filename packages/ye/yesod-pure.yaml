description: ! 'NOTE: Most of the concepts from this package have made it into yesod-core
  itself since the 1.2 release. Please see <http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2013/03/yesod-dispatch-version-1-2>
  for more information, or search the Haddocks for @LiteApp@.


  Provides helper functions to simplify programming of Yesod without any code generation

  some templating help is provided as well.'

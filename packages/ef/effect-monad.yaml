description: ! 'Provides the graded monad structure to Haskell with a number of analogs
  of familiar monads (Reader, Writer, State, Maybe, Counter, Update) and a wrapper
  over normal monads (Control.Effect.Monad). This provides a way to embed effect systems
  into Haskell. For more information see with paper \"Embedding effect systems in
  Haskell\" by Orchard and Petricek <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dao29/publ/haskell14-effects.pdf>
  (Haskell, 2014) and the examples in <https://github.com/dorchard/effect-monad/tree/master/examples>.

  (note, this package was previously called ''ixmonad'' until September 2014).'

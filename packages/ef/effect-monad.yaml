description: ! 'Provides the ''parametric effect monad'' structure to Haskell with
  a number of analogous of familiar monads (Reader, Writer, State, Maybe, Counter,
  Update) and a wrapper over normal monads (Control.Effect.Monad). This provides a
  way to embed effect systems into Haskell. For more information see with paper \"Embedding
  effect systems in Haskell\" by Orchard and Petricek <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dao29/publ/haskell14-effects.pdf>
  (Haskell, 2014) and the examples in <https://github.com/dorchard/effect-monad/tree/master/examples>.


  (note, this package was previously called ''ixmonad'' until September 2014).'

description: ! 'Hurdle - (H)askell (U)tilty (R)egarding (DL)l (E)xports.


  Extract function names from Windows DLLs a-la pexports.


  Hurdle has minimal dependencies: base, containers, and

  kangaroo (kangaroo just needs base and array).


  Currently Hurdle also has minimal utility - please consider

  pexports instead as Hurdle doesn''t yet print ordinals and

  fails on DLLs generated by Visual C++ (which puts function

  symbols in the .rdata section - gcc uses the .edata section).


  Hurdle was a Sunday afternoon hack that has taken a good while

  longer...

description: ! 'This library provide a Haskell binding to the libhungarian,

  a solver for Linear Sum Assignment Problem (LSAP) implemented

  in C language. It uses Hungarian algorithm

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm>, and runs

  in O(n^3) time. This implementation is efficient. Benchmarks

  versus pure haskell implementation are included (run

  "cabal bench").'

description: ! 'Cloud Haskell is a set of libraries that bring Erlang-style

  concurrency and distribution to Haskell programs. This

  project is an implementation of that distributed computing

  interface, where processes communicate with one another through

  explicit message passing rather than shared memory.


  This package is just a convenient wrapper

  around the @distributed-process-platform@, @distributed-process@ and

  @network-transport@ packages, so they can be

  installed with a single @cabal install cloud-haskell@

  command.


  The package also comes with flags to enable

  different @Network.Transport@ and /Cloud Haskell/

  (network topology) backends.'

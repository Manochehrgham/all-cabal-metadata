description: ! '### Cloud Haskell Build Umbrella


  This repository contains tools to assist with building and

  developing Cloud Haskell itself.


  ### Status


  Right now, there is a top-level Makefile that you can use to

  obtain a copy of all the relevant git repositories and a build.mk

  utility makefile that each project pulls in, which provides some

  common build infrastructure (based on cabal sandboxes).


  ### Usage


  To install from hackage, simply `cabal install cloud-haskell`.


  To install from sources, first of all, check out this repository from

  github, then cd into the newly created directory and run `make` to get

  a download of all the repositories. To then work with them, cd into a

  specific repo/directory and use one of the various make targets. Right

  now, you''ll have to look at build.mk yourself and figure out the gory

  details - we hope to improve on that soon!

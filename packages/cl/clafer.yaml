description: Clafer is a general purpose, lightweight, structural modeling language
  developed at GSD Lab, University of Waterloo, and MODELS group at IT University
  of Copenhagen. Lightweight modeling aims at improving the understanding of the problem
  domain in the early stages of software development and determining the requirements
  with fewer defects. Clafer's goal is to make modeling more accessible to a wider
  range of users and domains. The tool provides a reference language implementation.
  It translates models to other formats (e.g. Alloy, XML) to allow for reasoning with
  existing tools.

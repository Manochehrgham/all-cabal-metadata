description: ! 'This is a bunch of stuff I needed at some for manipulating sequence

  clusters. See the README for details. The tools included are:


  * filter - remove unwanted sequences from a clustering


  * hist   - produce a histogram of cluster sizes from a "label"-formatted clustering.


  * clusc  - compare clusterings, calculating numerous pair-based and entropy based
  indices.


  * add_single - add singletons to a clustering.


  * ace2contigs - parse an ACE assembly file, and output the contigs in a FASTA file.


  * ace2fasta - parse an ACE assembly, and output each assembly in a separate FASTA
  file


  * ace2clusters - parse an ACE assembly, and output clusters in TGICL format


  * clusterlibs - given a table of regular expressions and library names, along with
  a

  clustering (TGICL-format), output a table of cluster sizes per library.


  * xcerpt - extract sequences from a list of sequence labels.

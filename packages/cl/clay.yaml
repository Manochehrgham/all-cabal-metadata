description: ! 'Clay is a CSS preprocessor like LESS and Sass, but implemented as
  an embedded

  domain specific language (EDSL) in Haskell. This means that all CSS selectors

  and style rules are first class Haskell functions, which makes reuse and

  composability easy.


  The project is described on <http://fvisser.nl/clay>.


  The API documentation can be found in the top level module "Clay".


  > 0.10 -> 0.10.1

  > - Expose a render function for single selectors.

  > - Added super for vertical-align.

  > - Added support for border-collapse.

  > - Allow initial for the content property.

  > - Added support for CSS import.

  > Thanks to Heather, Collin J. Doering, Fraser Murray and Jonathan Fischoff.'

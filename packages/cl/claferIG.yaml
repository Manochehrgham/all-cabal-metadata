description: ! 'Clafer is a powerful (equivalent to first-order predicate logic) yet
  lightweight structural modeling language. Despite simplicity and conciseness of
  Clafer, writing correct models remains challenging due to hard-to-predict interactions
  among all constraints expressed in the model. Clafer instance generator (ClaferIG)
  is an interactive tool that generates instances and counter examples of concrete
  clafers in a Clafer model. If the concrete clafers do not have contradicting constraints,
  the generator produces valid instance data. Otherwise, the generator produces an
  unsatisfiable core which included all contradicting constraints and generates a
  counter example by removing one constraint from the core. The generator can potentially
  produce many instances if the concrete clafers are not fully specialized. The generator
  produces different instances on-demand. With these capabilities, the instance generator
  can be used for debugging models: checking the consistency of the model and detecting
  under- and overconstraining of the model. The instance generator can also be used
  programmatically via API (the command line and interactive session interfaces only
  use the API).'

description: ! 'Clutterhs is a binding to the Clutter C library. Clutter

  is an open source software library for creating fast,

  visually rich, portable and animated graphical user

  interfaces. Clutter uses OpenGL for rendering but with

  an API which hides the underlying GL complexity from the

  developer. The Clutter API is intended to be easy to use,

  efficient and flexible.'

description: ! 'CλaSH (pronounced ‘clash’) is a functional hardware description language
  that

  borrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language

  Haskell. The merits of using a functional language to describe hardware comes

  from the fact that combinational circuits can be directly modelled as

  mathematical functions and that functional languages lend themselves very well

  at describing and (de-)composing mathematical functions.

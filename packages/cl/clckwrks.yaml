description: ! 'clckwrks (pronounced, clockworks) aims to compete

  directly with popular PHP-based blogging and CMS

  platforms. Clckwrks aims to support one-click

  installation of plugins and themes. End users

  should be able to use it with zero Haskell

  knowledge. Haskell developers can extend clckwrks

  by creating new plugins or by building sites

  around the existing clckwrks core and plugins.


  clckwrks is still in very early development. Not all features have been implement
  yet.'

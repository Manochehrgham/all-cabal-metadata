description: ! '/Clipboard/ is a library for easily interfacing with the system clipboard
  with additional unicode support.

  Currently, only in a Windows system.


  For example, if you type:


  > $ setClipboardString "Hello, World!"


  Then you have @\"Hello, World!\"@ available to be pasted wherever you want.


  Now, if you type:


  > $ modifyClipboardString reverse


  You will have @\"!dlroW ,olleH\"@ in your clipboard. So:


  > $ getClipboardString

  > "!dlroW ,olleH"'

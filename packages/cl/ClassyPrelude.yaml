description: ! 'ClassyPrelude is a Prelude for people who know Haskell well. It

  re-exports some commonly imported modules, replaces Prelude

  functions with their type-class equivalents where reasonable, and

  removes some Prelude functions that in my opinion don''t belong

  there.

  These modules are likely to be incomplete. Suggestions are greatly appreciated.'

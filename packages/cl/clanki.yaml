description: Command-line spaced-repetition learning software. CL (command line) +
  Anki (popular spaced-repetition software) = Clanki. Usage is fairly simple, just
  follow the instructions after running the program. Add a deck, add cards to the
  deck, then quiz whenever possible. The program will determine what cards need to
  be reviewed, using the Super Memo 2 algorithm.

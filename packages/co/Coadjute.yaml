description: ! 'Coadjute is a generic build tool, intended as an easier to use and
  more

  portable replacement for make. It''s not tailored toward any particular

  language, and is not meant to replace tools which target a specific

  environment.


  Portability is striven towards in two ways:

  - You don''t have to deal with the idiosyncrasies of many make implementations

  (well, people don''t, but they call their GNU Make files makefiles

  instead of GNUmakefiles, which causes misunderstandings).

  - You have Haskell at your disposal, and are encouraged to use that

  whenever possible instead of system-specific binaries like the POSIX

  commands we all know and love.


  With support for:

  - Parallel task performing.

  - Advanced out-of-dateness detection:

  - Choice between timestamps and hashes.

  - Keeping track of what arguments have been passed.

  - Haskell!'

description: ! 'Sparse matrix linear-equation solver, using the conjugate gradient
  algorithm. Note that the

  technique only applies to matrices that are symmetric and positive-definite.

  See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method> for details.


  The conjugate gradient method can handle very large sparse matrices, where direct

  methods (such as LU decomposition) are way too expensive to be useful in practice.

  Such large sparse matrices arise naturally in many engineering problems, such as

  in ASIC placement algorithms and when solving partial differential equations.'

description: ! 'This package provides confidentiallity,

  integrity and replay detection. Users must

  provide ephemeral keys for one time use (reuse

  will compromise the security guarentees).

  Starting with shared secret, this package

  builds bi-directional channels for datagram

  based communication.'

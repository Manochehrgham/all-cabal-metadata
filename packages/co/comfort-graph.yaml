description: ! 'This graph structure is based on "Data.Map"

  and allows any ''Ord'' type for nodes

  and allows directed, undirected and more edge types.

  There is no need to map nodes to integer numbers.

  This makes handling in applications much more comfortable,

  thus the package name.


  Currently the package does not contain any advanced algorithm,

  just the data structure and some manipulation functions.


  The edge type can be freely chosen.

  This allows great flexibility

  but it is a bit more cumbersome to do in Haskell 98.

  Examples of edge types:


  * @DirEdge@: Edges in a directed graph


  * @UndirEdge@: Edges in an undirected graph


  * @EitherEdge@: For graphs containing both directed and undirected edges


  * You may define an edge type with an additional identifier

  in order to support multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.


  * Using type functions on the node type

  you may even define an edge type for nodes from a Cartesian product,

  where only \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" edges are allowed.


  For examples see the @linear-circuit@ package and its tests.

  The @ResistorCube@ test demonstrates non-integer node types

  and the @Tree@ test demonstrates multigraphs.


  The package is plain Haskell 98.

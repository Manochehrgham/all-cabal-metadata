description: ! 'Libraries such as binary and cereal support sequential reading and
  writing but do not rely on any further operations. Many media support seeking in
  files as well. This library implements a file format that supports random access
  to data entities by seeking.


  This library also uses the syb-with-class library to streamline implementation of
  serializers for various data entities, so that you don''t have to write much boilerplate

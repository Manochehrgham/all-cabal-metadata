description: ! 'Commando comes in two forms - A library and an executable.


  * Executable


  Watch a directory, and when changes occur, run a command.


  From the commandline the program is used like so:


  > commando -c echo


  This will watch the current directory, and when an event occurs, pass the serialized

  representation of the event as an argument to `echo`.


  * Library


  To use the library just


  > import System.Commando


  See the "System.Commando" module documentation for more details.


  The Commando executable module is a good example of using Commando as a library.'

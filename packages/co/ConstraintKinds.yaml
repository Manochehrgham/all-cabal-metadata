description: ! 'This module provides more flexible versions of common type classes
  that use the ConstraintKinds extension.  This allows us to make types that require
  constraints instances of the popular classes.  For example, we reimplement Functor
  and Foldable using the ContraintKinds style.  This allows us to manipulate lists
  and unboxed vectors using the same functions.


  This library needs a lot of work before it can be considered ready for others to
  use.  Right now, only those instances needed by the HLearn library have been implemented
  in this library.'

description: ! 'This package provides a simple interface to Concorde, a solver for
  the

  Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Concorde is available from

  <http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/concorde/index.html>.


  This library uses the Linâ€“Kernighan heuristic via Concorde''s @linkern@

  program.  It quickly produces good tours, which may not be optimal.  You

  can directly control the tradeoff between run time and solution quality.


  An example program is included.


  Currently, only problems in two-dimensional Euclidean space are supported.


  More features of Concorde can be added on request.  Feature requests and

  patches are always welcome.'

description: ! 'The package provides normal forms for monads and related structures,
  similarly to the Operational package.

  The difference is that we parameterise the normal forms on a constraint, and apply
  that constraint to all

  existential types within the normal form.

  This allows monad (and other) instances to be generated for underlying types that
  require constraints on

  their return-like and bind-like operations, e.g. Set.


  This is documented in the following paper:


  The Constrained-Monad Problem.  Neil Sculthorpe and Jan Bracker and George Giorgidze
  and Andy Gill.

  International Conference on Functional Programming, pages 287-298. ACM, 2013.

  <http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2500365.2500602>


  The functionality exposed by this library is also used internally by the Set-Monad
  and RMonad packages.'

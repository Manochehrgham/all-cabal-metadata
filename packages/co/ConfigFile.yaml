description: ! 'Parser and writer for handling sectioned config files in

  Haskell.


  The ConfigFile module works with configuration files in a standard

  format that is easy for the user to edit, easy for the programmer

  to work with, yet remains powerful and flexible.  It is inspired by,

  and compatible with, Python''s ConfigParser module.  It uses files

  that resemble Windows .INI-style files, but with numerous

  improvements.


  ConfigFile provides simple calls to both read and write config files.

  It''s possible to make a config file parsable by this module,

  the Unix shell, and make.'

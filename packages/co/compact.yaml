description: ! 'This package provides user-facing APIs for working with

  "compact regions", which hold a fully evaluated Haskell object graph.

  These regions maintain the invariant that no pointers live inside the struct

  that point outside it, which ensures efficient garbage collection without

  ever reading the structure contents (effectively, it works as a manually

  managed "oldest generation" which is never freed until the whole is

  released).

  This package is currently highly experimental, but we hope it may

  be useful to some people.  It is GHC 8.2 only.  The bare-bones library

  that ships with GHC is ghc-compact.'

description: ! 'The base package''s ''Data.Complex'' has a ''RealFloat'' requirement
  for

  almost all operations, which rules out uses such as ''Complex Rational''

  or ''Complex Integer''.  This package provides an alternative, putting

  most operations into additional type classes.  Generating instances

  with template haskell helps reduce excessive boilerplate and avoids

  instance overlap.'

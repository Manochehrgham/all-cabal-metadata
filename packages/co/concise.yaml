description: ! 'Utilities for ``Control.Lens.Cons``

  ===================================


  This library provides a few utility types and functions for working

  with ``Control.Lens.Cons``.  Rewrite rules are employed to make

  common conversions perform as well as the "native" but non-generic

  conversion (e.g. ``String`` to ``Text``, lazy to strict, etc).

description: ! 'This package is a thin wrapper around http-enumerator to access a
  Couch DB Database,

  using the aeson package to parse and encode JSON data.  http-enumerator, aeson,
  and

  attoparsec fit togther so well that this package is mostly just a direct combination

  of these packages.  The single additional feature in this package is an attoparsec
  parser

  for views, which allows constant memory processing of view returns.

  This package is deprecated by <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/couchdb-conduit>'

description: ! 'In computer science there are a number of standard test problems that
  are used for testing algorithms,

  especially those related to Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research. Online
  there are a number

  of repositories for collections of known interesting problems, for example the TSPLIB
  at

  <http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/> and the SATLIB at

  <http://www.satlib.org/>.


  This library seeks to provide implementations of data structures to store these
  problems, along with

  functions for manipulating the problems and routines to load problem files from
  various sources.


  At present it supports TSP\/TSPLIB, SAT\/SATLIB and TIM (format used by the International
  Timetabling Competition,

  which has been run twice at current date), however it is hoped that the loading
  routines

  can be expanded and the range of problems expanded to cover problems like scheduling
  and more general timetabling.

  The internal data structures make heavy use of the @Data.Map@ library and @Data.Array@.
  It is not currently

  using unboxed values. The library does not use the @bytestring@ library for loading
  and saving data either,

  which will probably need to be changed later.'

description: ! 'PLEASE NOTE:  This package is deprecated in favor of

  contstuff-transformers, which generalizes to all transformers-based

  libraries.

  This package provides contstuff transformer class instances for the

  monad transformers from the monads-tf package as well as monads-tf

  transformer class instances for the monad transformers from

  contstuff.  This makes using both transformer libraries in a single

  project much more convenient as you get along with a single set of

  lifting functions.'

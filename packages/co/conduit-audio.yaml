description: ! '@conduit-audio@ applies @conduit@''s streaming data abilities

  to efficiently manipulate audio files and streams.

  Simple combinator functions let you mix files together,

  cut and paste sections of audio,

  and apply more complicated transformations like resampling or timestretching,

  all with the following properties:


  * Tiny memory usage, proportional only to the number of simultaneous sources\/effects


  * Uses no temporary files; everything is done in one pass


  * Blazing fast! (for most uses)'

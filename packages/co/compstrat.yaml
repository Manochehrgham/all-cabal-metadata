description: ! 'A library for strategic programming on compositional data types. See

  /The Essence of Strategic Programming/, <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.5296&rep=rep1&type=pdf>,

  by Ralf Laemmel et al.


  Strategic programming is a way of allowing traversals to be written in a highly

  generic and composable fashion.


  The names and general interface are modeled on the KURE library,

  but this library tries to be as composable as the lens library.


  The type of a

  strategy combinator is the same as the /Vertical/ type

  that ekmett proposed and rejected as an extension to the current

  lens library. A /Vertical/ is essentially a monadic traversal. This hence

  could potentially be merged with the lens library.'

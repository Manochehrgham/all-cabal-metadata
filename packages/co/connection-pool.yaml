description: ! 'Connection poll is a family specialised resource pools. Currently
  package

  provides two variants:


  1. pool for TCP client connections,


  2. and pool for UNIX Sockets client connections.


  This package is built on top of

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/resource-pool resource-pool> and

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-commons streaming-commons>.

  The later allows us to use

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit-extra conduit-extra> package

  for implementation of TCP or UNIX Sockets clients.


  For examples and other details see documentation in "Data.ConnectionPool"

  module.'

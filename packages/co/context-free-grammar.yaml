description: ! 'Basic algorithms on context-free grammars:


  * augmenting a grammar


  * calculating nullability


  * calculating reachability


  * calculating productivity


  * calculating first sets


  * calculating follow sets


  * calculating predict sets


  You may define your context-free grammar textually using ''parse''

  or with the quasiquoter ''bnf'' (both in "Data.Cfg.Bnf"), or you may

  use any data structure you like after making it an instance of

  ''Cfg'' (found in "Data.Cfg.Cfg").


  Testing is very thin in this version; basically just

  sanity-checking.'

description: ! 'Contracts describe properties of expressions (esp. functions) that
  are

  checked at run-time.

  For example, a contract states that an expression is a natural number,

  a list has at least one element or a function requires a natural number

  and a non-empty list of natural numbers as arguments and will produce a

  natural number as result.

  Thus these properties are both documented and enforced.

  Contracts are more expressive than static types.

  If a contract is violated, then an informative exception is raised.

  See homepage or Olaf Chitil: "Practical Typed Lazy Contracts", ICFP 2012, ACM.'

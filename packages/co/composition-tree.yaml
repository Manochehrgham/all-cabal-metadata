description: A compositions list or composition tree is a list data type where the
  elements are monoids, and the mconcat of any contiguous sublist can be computed
  in logarithmic time. A common use case of this type is in a wiki, version control
  system, or collaborative editor, where each change or delta would be stored in a
  list, and it is sometimes necessary to compute the composed delta between any two
  versions.

description: ! 'This package provides a framework for computations with certain

  consistency constraints. Based on this framework, it implements

  resourceful computations, which are an alternative to the @IO@

  mondad. In the case of resourceful computations, the consistency

  constraint is a single-use policy, also known as linearity.'

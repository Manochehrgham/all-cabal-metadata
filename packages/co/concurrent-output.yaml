synopsis: Ungarble output from several threads
changelog: ! "concurrent-output (1.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Renamed many
  of the functions and types.\n  * Added tuneDisplay, which makes it easy to size-limit
  regions,\n    right-justify regions, or otherwise transform how their values are\n
  \   displayed.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 04 Nov 2015 00:32:38 -0400\n\nconcurrent-output
  (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * The contents of a Region can now be set
  to a STM Text\n    transaction. Their display will be automatically updated whenever
  the\n    transaction's value changes.\n  * Removed updateRegionListSTM, and export
  regionList instead, which is\n    more general-purpose.\n  * Other improvements
  to STM interface.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 03 Nov 2015 15:50:47 -0400\n\nconcurrent-output
  (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Avoid crash when not all of a program's
  output is consumed, as\n    happens when eg, piping to head(1).\n  * Use text, and
  not bytestring internally.\n  * Added createProcessForeground, useful for running
  commands like vim.\n  * Fix race that sometimes caused processes to run in background
  mode\n    even though no other foreground process was still running.\n  * Concurrent
  process functions now use ConcurrentProcessHandle\n    instead of ProcessHandle.\n
  \ * Multi-line regions now supported.\n  * Optimize region update, avoiding outputting
  characters already on-screen.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 02 Nov 2015
  23:25:40 -0400\n\nconcurrent-output (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Renamed
  module.\n  * Incorporated console region support, based on Joachim Breitner's\n
  \   concurrentoutput library.\n  * Fix race that sometimes prevented a concurrent
  processes's output from\n    being displayed as program shut down.\n\n -- Joey Hess
  <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 30 Oct 2015 21:27:41 -0400\n\nconcurrent-output (1.0.1) unstable;
  urgency=medium\n\n  * Generalize what can be output.\n  * Dropped dependency on
  MissingH; added dependency on text.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 29 Oct
  2015 00:47:12 -0400\n\nconcurrent-output (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  *
  First release.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 28 Oct 2015 21:01:23 -0400\n"

description: ! 'Provides a simple interface for writing concurrent programs that

  need to output a lot of status messages to the console, or display

  multiple progress bars for different activities at the same time,

  or concurrently run external commands that output to the console.


  Built on top of that is a way of defining multiple output regions,

  which are automatically laid out on the screen and can be individually

  updated. Can be used for progress displays etc.

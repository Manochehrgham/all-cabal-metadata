description: ! 'Libraries for the Copilot language.


  Copilot is a stream (i.e., infinite lists) domain-specific language (DSL) in

  Haskell that compiles into embedded C.  Copilot contains an interpreter,

  multiple back-end compilers, and other verification tools.  A tutorial, bug

  reports, and todos are available at

  <https://github.com/leepike/copilot-discussion>.


  Examples are available at

  <https://github.com/leepike/Copilot/tree/master/Examples>.'

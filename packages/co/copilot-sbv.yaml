description: ! "Overview\n========\n[copilot-sbv](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-sbv)
  Another back-end\nthat translates to [SBV](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv),
  using its code\ngenerator to generate hard real-time C code as well.  The ad\n\nCopilot
  is a stream (i.e., infinite lists) domain-specific language (DSL) in\nHaskell that
  compiles into embedded C.  Copilot is similar in spirit to\nlanguages like Lustre.
  \ Copilot contains an interpreter, multiple back-end\ncompilers, and other verification
  tools.\n\nExamples\n=========\nPlease see the files under the Examples directory
  in the\n[Copilot](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot) for a number of examples\nshowing
  the syntax, use of libraries, and use of the interpreter and back-ends.\nThe examples
  is the best way to start.\n\nInstallation\n============\nThe Copilot library is
  cabalized. Assuming you have cabal and the GHC compiler\ninstalled (the [Haskell
  Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) is the\neasiest way to obtain these),
  it should merely be a matter of running \n     \n         cabal install copilot-sbv\n\nHowever,
  we strongly recommend you install Copilot, which installs copilot-sbv\nand other
  packages automatically.  Execute\n\n         cabal install copilot\n\nDependencies\n=============\ncopilot-sbv
  depends on the [SBV](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv) library\nto generate
  hard real-time C code.\n\nResources\n=========\n[copilot-sbv](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/copilot-sbv)
  is available on\nHackage.\n\n**Sources** for each package are available on Github
  as well.  Just go to\n[Github](github.com) and search for the package of interest.

description: ! 'Eventually consistent STM transactions.

  \

  Consistent provides eventually consistent atomic transactions, by delaying

  updates until no threads is mutating a shared variable.

  \

  This comes at a cost of having a separate TVar for every thread, but has the

  advantage that no thread will ever lock or retry except for the manager actor

  responsible for performing the updates.'

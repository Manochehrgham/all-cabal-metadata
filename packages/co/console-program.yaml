synopsis: Interpret the command line and settings in a config file as commands and
  options
changelog: ! "# Changelog\n\n## 0.4.0.0\n\n* API change: the `Command` constructor
  now takes an extra argument\n  (specifying whether the command can be abbreviated
  on the command line).\n  The function `command` can be used instead of the old constructor.\n*
  Better handling of exceptions in interactive mode.\n\n### 0.3.2\n\n* Generalise
  actions to allow any instance of MonadIO.\n"

description: ! 'This library provides a framework to build command line programs.



  The constructed program can have several \"commands\" that provide different modes
  of operation.

  Options can be declared to allow fine-tuning of the behaviour of the program.

  These options are read from the command line when running the program

  and from a simple configuration file.



  Additionally, there is an interactive mode that reads and executes commands from
  standard input.



  Examples of using this library may be found in the Examples directory in the package
  tarball.



  It provides functionality similar to the cmdargs package. Main differences:


  - console-program does not use unsafePerformIO, and tries to give a more haskellish,
  referentially transparent interface;


  - it allows a full tree of commands, instead of a list, so a command can have subcommands;


  - it parses a configuration file, in addition to the command line arguments.'

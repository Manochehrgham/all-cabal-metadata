description: ! '* @class Countable@, for countable types


  * @class AtLeastOneCountable@, for countable types that have at least one value


  * @class InfiniteCountable@, for infinite countable types


  * @class Searchable@, for types that can be searched over. This turns out to include
  some infinite types, see <http://math.andrej.com/2007/09/28/seemingly-impossible-functional-programs/>.


  * @class Finite@, for finite types


  * @class Empty@, for empty types


  * @data Nothing@, an empty type


  Some orphan instances:


  * @(Searchable a,Eq b) => Eq (a -> b)@ / /


  * @(Finite t) => Foldable ((->) t)@ / /


  * @(Finite a) => Traversable ((->) a)@ / /


  * @(Show a,Finite a,Show b) => Show (a -> b)@ / /'

description: ! 'This module provides the drawing code for CodeWorld.  It is heavily
  inspired by

  Gloss, but modified for consistency and pedagogical reasons.


  It comes with two backends. When compiled with GHCJS, it uses the JavaScript FFI
  to

  run on <http://code.world/>.  When compiled with GHC, it uses the blank-canvas

  package to provide a webpage consisting of just a panel locally. This way, the same

  program that runs on the CodeWorld server can also be run locally.'

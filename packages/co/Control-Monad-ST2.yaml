description: ! 'The ST2 monad is like the ST monad, but with

  finer-grained control over access to mutable

  state. The phantom type parameters r and w are

  used to track the read and write dependencies of

  the computation. If a computation of type ST2 r w a

  is polymorphic in w then it does not write any

  external state. If it is also polymorphic in r

  then it does not read any external state.'

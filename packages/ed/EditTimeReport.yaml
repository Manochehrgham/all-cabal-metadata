description: ! 'This program can be used to see exactly how much time

  you spent working on file X, project Y or language Z.

  It can also be used to see for instance what your most

  productive time of the year, month or week is.

  In the long-run, this might help you make better time

  estimates, while also providing you with an overview

  of what you have worked on (which can also be nice for CV''s).

  In short; this program allows you to query your logs

  and generate reports in plain text, html, xhtml and CSV.

  Support for more output formats is planned for the future.

  See the github page for more information.'

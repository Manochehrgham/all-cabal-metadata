description: ! 'ED-E is a templating language written in Haskell with a specific set
  of features:


  * Logicless within reason. A small set of consistent predicates

  and expressions for formatting and presentational logic are provided.


  * Secure. No arbitrary code evaluation, with input data required to be fully specified

  at render time.


  * Stateless. Parsing and rendering are separate steps so that loading, parsing,

  include resolution, and embedding of the compiled template can optionally be

  done ahead of time, amortising cost.


  * Markup agnostic. ED-E is used to write out everything from configuration files
  for

  system services, to HTML and formatted emails.


  * Control over purity. Users can choose pure or IO-based resolution of

  @include@ expressions.


  * No surprises. All parsing, type assurances, and rendering steps report helpful

  error messages with line/column metadata. Variable shadowing, unprintable expressions,

  implicit type coercion, and unbound variable access are all treated as errors.'

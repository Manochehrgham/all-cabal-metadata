description: ! "# editor-open\n\nYou know when you run `git commit`, and an editor
  pops open so you can enter a\ncommit message? This is a Haskell library that does
  that.\n\nThis library isn't very portable. It relies on the `$EDITOR` environment\nvariable.
  The concept only exists on *nix systems.\n\n# Installing\n\nIf you're using this
  library, I assume you're familiar with the basic\ninfrastructure of Haskell programs.
  If not, check out\n[Bitemyapp's guide](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell).\n\nJust
  add `editor-open` to the `build-depends:` field in your project's `.cabal`\nfile.\n\nAlternatively,
  you can just do a one-off installation with:\n\n```\ncabal install editor-open\n```\n\n#

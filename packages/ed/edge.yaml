description: ! 'The Edge has always been a rough patch of interstellar

  space filled with innumerable bad guys of every nefarious

  sort, and dangerous debris flying in every direction at

  high speeds. But now it has grown out of control and is

  threatening to overflow into colonial space. Central

  command has decided to send in their newest super weapon,

  the Mark II Lance fighter, piloted by their top ace pilot.

  Good luck commander!'

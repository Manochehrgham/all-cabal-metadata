description: ! 'This package provides a library for semi-explicit parallel programming

  with Eden. Eden extends Haskell with a small set of syntactic constructs

  for explicit process specification and creation. While providing enough

  control to implement parallel algorithms efficiently, it frees the

  programmer from the tedious task of managing low-level details by

  introducing automatic communication (via head-strict lazy lists),

  synchronisation, and process handling.

  The Eden-modules depend on GHC, and should normally use a GHC extension

  to support parallel execution using message passing.

  This modified GHC-Eden compiler is available from

  <http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~eden>.

  When built using a standard GHC, this package will produce a

  threaded simulation of Eden.

  The Eden homepage     <http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/~eden>

  provides more documentation and a tutorial.'

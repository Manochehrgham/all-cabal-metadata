description: ! 'An implementation of the Wagnerâ€“Fischer dynamic programming algorithm
  to

  find the optimal edit script and cost between two sequences.


  The implementation in this package is specialised to sequences represented

  with "Data.Vector" but is otherwise agnostic to:


  * The type of values in the vectors;


  * The type representing edit operations; and


  * The type representing the cost of operations.

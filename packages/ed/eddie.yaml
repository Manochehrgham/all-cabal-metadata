description: ! "# What is eddie?\n\nA command line tool for running Haskell functions
  over text files.\n\nIt is also useful for prototyping Haskell text processing functions\nthat
  you will later copy into a program.\n\n# Why is eddie?\n\nThis project actually
  started in response to a code bounty for a\nclojure shell scripting tool. That resulted
  in a specification for the\nrequested program that had all the features of eddie,
  and then\nsome. However, clojure code embedded on the command line looks clumsy,\nso
  the project was shelved.\n\nIn haskell, functional expression are much simpler and
  more\nelegant. In particular, in looking for haskell command line tools, I\nfound
  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Simple_unix_tools>, which\nconvinced me that
  the original design would be not merely usable, but\nelegant if the expressions
  were done in haskell. Hence, eddie.\n\n# Why not `ghc -e`?\n\nEddie adds features
  to make using it for shell scripting easier:\n\n  *  When given file arguments,
  eddie feeds them to your function.\n  *  Eddie can easily add modules to the namespace
  you use.\n  *  Eddie has options for processing things a line or file at a time.\n
  \ *  Eddie will use binary file IO methods when asked to.\n\n# More information\n\nThe
  best place to start is the manual. That's available in the source\ntree in both
  man format in `eddie.1`, and in html in `eddie.html`.\nThe latter is also available
  [online](eddie.html).\n\n# Installation\n\nInstall or build with cabal as usual.\n\n#
  Testing\n\nTest use the haskell shelltestrunner package (can be installed with\ncabal).
  Run `shelltest tests` in the source directory to run\nthe tests with the currently
  installed eddie. Use\n`shelltest tests -w eddie.hs` to run them using the current\nsource.
  Use `shelltest tests -w dist/build/eddie/eddie` to\nrun them with the compiled binary.\n\n#
  Documentation\n\nThe documenation is built with `pandoc` from\n`eddie.md`.  Use
  the `-s` flag, and convert from\npandoc's markdown to your chosen format.\n"

description: ! 'The Eden Trace Viewer is a tool designed to help

  programmers optimize Eden programs by visualising traces

  (eventlog files) of Eden program runs. It is similar to

  (and precedes) threadscope. However, it has been designed

  to visualize not just threads, but also different

  machines, processes, and messages between processes.

  EdenTV can show you what has happened during the

  execution of your program. This is very helpful to

  optimize parallel programs.'

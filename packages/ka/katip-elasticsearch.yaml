synopsis: ElasticSearch scribe for the Katip logging framework.
changelog: ! "0.2.0.0\n==============\n\n* Default index sharding policy to daily.
  Previously it was no\n  sharding. The reasoning here is that no sharding creates
  very large\n  indices which become very difficult to manage in\n  production. Rotating
  data out on a time basis is very slow compared\n  to deleting date-based indices.\n\n
  \ Upgrade note: if you were using the defaults before and switch to\n  daily, rather
  than having the index name of `my-index`, you'll start\n  seeing `my-index-2016-3-14`.
  The good news is that whatever you're\n  using to use to search against your logs
  (such as kibana) will\n  support index patterns, so just use the pattern of `my-index*`
  to\n  get everything. Eventually if you have a retention period, you can\n  manually
  delete the `my-index` index without disruption.\n\n\n0.1.1.0\n==============\n\n*
  Set upper bounds for a few dependencies.\n\n0.1.0.0\n==============\n\n* Initial
  release\n"

description: ! "# Katip Elasticsearch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/katip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Soostone/katip)\n\nkatip-elasticsearch
  is a scribe for the Katip logging framework that\nsends structured logs to ElasticSearch.\n\n##
  Features\n\n* Built in bounded buffering.\n\n* Configurable pool of logging workers
  to help with high write\n  volume.\n\n* Optional field type annotation to avoid
  mistyping values.\n\n* Optional automatic date sharding, so logs can be filed into
  monthly,\n  weekly, daily, hourly, every minute indices. You can even specify\n
  \ your own index routing logic. This pattern can be seen in the ELK\n  stack as
  a way of keeping indexes reasonably sized and easy to\n  optimize, rotate, and manage.\n\n*
  Customizable retry policy for temporary outages and errors.\n\n* Automatic index
  and mapping setup.\n\n"

description: ! 'TBC is a harness for running tests, relying on other libraries such

  as QuickCheck and HUnit to do the actual testing. TBC lets you skip a

  lot of boilerplate by adopting naming conventions for tests. It also

  supports test-driven development (TDD) by running as many tests as it

  can compile, whatever the state of the project as a whole.

  For further information see the examples that accompany the

  distribution.'

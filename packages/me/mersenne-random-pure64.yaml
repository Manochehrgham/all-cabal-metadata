description: ! 'The Mersenne twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed
  by

  Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura that is based on a matrix linear

  recurrence over a finite binary field. It provides for fast generation

  of very high quality pseudorandom numbers. The source for the C code

  can be found here:


  <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt64.html>


  This library provides a purely functional binding to the 64 bit

  classic mersenne twister, along with instances of RandomGen, so the

  generator can be used with System.Random. The generator should

  typically be a few times faster than the default StdGen (but a tad

  slower than the impure ''mersenne-random'' library based on SIMD

  instructions and destructive state updates.

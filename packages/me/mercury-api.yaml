  This package is a Haskell binding to the [Mercury API][5] C API for

  [ThingMagic][6] RFID readers.  It is especially geared toward

  the [SparkFun Simultaneous RFID Reader][1], which uses ThingMagic''s

  [M6e Nano][7] module, but it should work with other ThingMagic

  readers.  (Though currently, only support for serial readers is

  compiled in.)  Most of the function and type names are the same as

  their counterparts in the C API, with the `TMR_` prefix dropped.  For

  more in-depth, language-independent documentation of Mercury API, see

  [Mercury API Programmers Guide][2].


  This package includes a copy of the Mercury API C library, so no

  external libraries are necessary.  Several small bug fixes have been

  applied to the included version of the library.  (I have submitted

  these patches upstream, but I don''t know if or when they will be

  included in the official version.)  If you need to upgrade to a newer

  version of Mercury API than the included one, see [UPGRADING.md][9].


  The Haskell binding doesn''t support background reads.  I recommend

  that you just spawn a new Haskell thread and do foreground reads

  instead.


  Currently, only support for the serial reader is compiled in, but it

  probably wouldn''t be too hard to enable LLRP support.  (I don''t have

  any way to test LLRP, however, as the M6e Nano doesn''t support it.)


  On Mac OS X, be sure to use the serial device that starts with

  `/dev/cu.`, not the serial device that starts with `/dev/tty.`.


  Only some parameters and some tagops are currently supported in the

  Haskell binding.  (There are a lot of them, and I only implemented the

  ones I needed.)  If you need support for additional parameters or

  tagops, please file an issue in GitHub and I will add them.

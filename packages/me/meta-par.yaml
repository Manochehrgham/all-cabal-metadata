description: ! 'This library provides a composable abstraction for /Resources/ which

  can be mixed and matched to build /Schedulers/.

  A `Resource` typically corresponds to a specific kind of hardware or

  to a style of scheduling.  This package contains implementations of

  basic `Resource`s that implement parallel scheduling on the CPU.

  To use a complete meta-par Scheduler, import Control.Monad.Par.SMP for

  example, which will provide a `runPar` as well as instances for the

  relevant classes that enable `Par` programming (e.g. `ParFuture`).'

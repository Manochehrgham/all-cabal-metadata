synopsis: A memcached client library.
changelog: ! '# 0.1.X.X


  * Consistent usage of ''memcached'' instead of ''memcache''.

  * Document `Database.Memcache.Client`

  * Add inline pragmas in appropriate places.


  # 0.1.0.0


  * First proper release (although still lots of rough edges!)

  * Filled out `Data.Memcache.Client` to a complete API.

  * Integrated cluster and authentication handling.

  * Better error and exception handling.

  * Fix compilation under GHC 7.10.


  # 0.0.1


  * Initial (incomplete) support for a cluster of memcached servers.

  * Fixed compilation under GHC 7.4.


  # 0.0.0


  * Initial release. Support for a single server.

  \ \"BSD3 License\"\n\nA client library for a memcached cluster.\n\nIt supports the
  binary memcached protocol and SASL authentication. No support\nfor the ASCII protocol
  is provided. It supports connecting to a single, or a\ncluster of memcached servers.
  When connecting to a cluser, consistent hashing\nis used for routing requests to
  the appropriate server.\n\nComplete coverage of the memcached protocol is provided
  except for multi-get\nand other pipelined operations.\n\n## Licensing\n\nThis library
  is BSD-licensed.\n\n## Tools\n\nThis library also includes a few tools for manipulating
  and experimenting with\nmemcached servers.\n\n* `OpGen` -- A load generator for
  memcached. Doesn't collect timing statistics,\n  other tools like [mutilate](https://github.com/leverich/mutilate)
  already do\n  that very well. This tool is useful in conjunction with mutilate.\n*
  `Loader` -- A tool to load random data of a certain size into a memcached\n  server.
  Useful for priming a server for testing.\n\n## Architecture Notes\n\nWe're relying
  on `Data.Pool` for thread safety right now, which is fine but is\na blocking API
  in that when we grab a socket (`withResource`) we are blocking\nany other requests
  being sent over that connection until we get a response.\nThat is, we can't pipeline.\n\nNow,
  use of multiple connections through the pool abstraction is an easy way to\nsolve
  this and perhaps the right approach. But, could also implement own pool\nabstraction
  that allowed pipelining. This wouldn't be a pool abstraction so\nmuch as just round-robbining
  over multiple connections for performance.\n\nEither way, a pool is fine for now.\n\n##

description: ! '"memscript <filename>"

  Run memscript with a UTF-8 (or ASCII since ASCII is a subset of UTF8)

  plain text file.  Try to exactly guess the text line by line.  If

  your guess is wrong it will show you a diff like output comparing

  your guess and the original verse.  This will repeat until you get

  all the verses right.

  For the test data I included four beloved Psalms (1,23,121,127)

  from the Old Testament, each in Revised Korean Version (RKV) and

  New International Version (NIV), which I happened to have had to

  memorize.  You can use it for any other text you''d want to memorize,

  such as your favorite poems, quotes, or whatsoever.

  No craft or ticks, really simple and straightforward utility but

  serves well for the purpose.  I used readline because that was

  the only sane way I know of handling multibyte inputs.

  This update of the version is simply because there has been

  some changes in the System.IO library, fixing the problem of

  handling multibyte characters becaus of the library update

  (no need to use utf8-string any more).'

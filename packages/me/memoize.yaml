description: ! 'This library provides a type class ''Memoizable'' for memoizing

  functions, along with instances for a variety of argument types.

  It includes a Template Haskell function for deriving

  ''Memoizable'' instances for arbitrary algebraic datatypes.


  The library constructs pure memo caches without the use of

  ''unsafePerformIO''.  This technique relies on implementation

  assumptions that, while not guaranteed by the semantics of

  Haskell, appear to be true.'

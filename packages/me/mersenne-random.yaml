description: ! 'The Mersenne twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed
  by

  Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura that is based on a matrix linear

  recurrence over a finite binary field. It provides for fast generation

  of very high quality pseudorandom numbers


  This library uses SFMT, the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister, a

  variant of Mersenne Twister that is much faster than the original.

  It is designed to be fast when it runs on 128-bit SIMD. It can be

  compiled with either SSE2 and PowerPC AltiVec support, to take

  advantage of these instructions.


  > cabal install -fuse_sse2


  On an x86 system, for performance win.


  By default the period of the function is 2^19937-1, however, you can

  compile in other defaults. Note that this algorithm on its own

  is not cryptographically secure.


  For more information about the algorithm and implementation, see

  the SFMT homepage,

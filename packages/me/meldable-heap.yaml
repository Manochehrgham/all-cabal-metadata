description: ! 'A heap is a container supporting the insertion of elements and the
  extraction of the minimum element. This library additionally supports melding two
  heaps. This library models the implementation of asymptotically optimal purely functional
  heaps given by Brodal and Okasaki in their paper \"Optimal Purely Functional Priority
  Queues\". It has been proved correct using the Coq proof assistant. The proofs are
  included in the Cabal package.


  A description of the differences between versions of this package is available at
  <http://priority-queues.googlecode.com/hg/brodal-okasaki/cabal/CHANGELOG>.'

description: ! 'The Darcs Patch Manager (/DPM/ for short) is a tool that simplifies
  working

  with the revision control system darcs (<http://darcs.net>). It is most

  effective when used in an environment where developers do not push their

  patches directly to the main repository but where patches undergo a

  reviewing process before they are actually applied. See the documentation

  of the module "DPM.Tutorial" for a short tutorial.'

description: ! 'Using this package can cause the vectorised program to have worse

  asymptotic complexity than the original.

  Use dph-lifted-vseg instead.

  This package provides the following:

  nested arrays and the primitive operators that work on them (PA functions);

  the lifted array combinators that the vectoriser introduces (PP functions);

  the user facing library functions that work on [::] style arrays (P functions).

  Deprecated implementation that performs deep copying replicate.'

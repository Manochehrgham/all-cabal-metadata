description: ! 'Similar to popular database frontend interfaces like sqlite3, this

  project provides a full featured CLI for YQL.

  It extends YQL introducing the concept of of location functions.

  These have the same concept of YQL functions except they are

  intercepted by the program itself and executed locally. For

  instance, changing the format to json or turning diagnostics on

  are examples of such functions.'

description: ! 'This is a wrapper to gnuplot

  which lets you create 2D and 3D plots.


  Start a simple session with @make ghci@.

  This loads the module "Graphics.Gnuplot.Simple"

  which is ready for use in GHCi.

  It does not address all fancy gnuplot features

  in order to stay simple.

  For more sophisticated plots,

  especially batch generated graphics,

  I recommend "Graphics.Gnuplot.Advanced".

  This module contains also an overview

  of the hierarchy of objects.


  Examples for using this interface can be found in the "Demo" module.

  In order to compile this and install an example data file,

  use the Cabal flag @buildExamples@:


  > $ cabal install -fbuildExamples gnuplot


  With the Cabal flags executePipe and executeShell

  you can switch to more convenient

  but probably less portable ways

  of feeding gnuplot with a script.


  Alternative packages: @plot@, @HPlot@, @Chart@, @textPlot@, @easyplot@'

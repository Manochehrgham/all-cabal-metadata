description: ! 'This is a fork of Dominic Orchard''s syntax-trees package that is
  patched

  just to build on Haskell''s more modern ecosystem.


  Provides an instance that translates haskell-src-exts expression trees into

  Template Haskell expression trees in a way that depends only on the

  haskell-src-exts syntax tree and agreement on the pretty-printed

  representation of Haskell between haskell-src-exts pretty-printer and

  Template Haskell quotations (as opposed to depending on both TH and

  haskell-src-exts syntax tree representations).


  Instead of converting between data types,

  haskell-src-exts syntax trees are pretty-printed and wrapped in

  a TH quotation which is then interpreted as a Haskell program,

  yielding a TH Exp tree. Free variables in the haskell-src-exts tree are

  preserved by lifting them to TH splices prior to pretty-printing.'

description: ! 'Provides importers for FR3D resource files. Of particular

  interest are basepairs files which describe canonical and

  non-canonical (non-Watson-Crick) base pairings in RNA secondary

  structure.


  The original FR3D paper is:


  FR3D: Finding Local and Composite Recurrent Structural Motifs

  in RNA 3D Structures, Michael Sarver; Craig L. Zirbel; Jesse

  Stombaugh; Ali Mokdad; Neocles B. Leontis. /Journal of

  Mathematical Biology/ (2008) 56:215â€“252.


  Changes since any 0.1.*:


  * Zero-based indexing (FR3D is one-based!) for sequence

  positions. We do not change the nucleotide PDB number.


  * Some sanity checks, a number of FR3D files fall through at

  this and need to be checked for consistency'

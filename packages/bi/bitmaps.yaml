description: ! 'Library defining several bitmap types, including ones stored as unboxed

  arrays, any string type, and functions


  This library also supports conversion to and from bitmaps as defined in the

  "bitmap" package.


  This library has not yet been tested extensively.


  Note: This library is currently largely designed with RGB pixels with a

  color depth of 24 bits in mind.  Better support for other pixel and color

  formats is intended to be implemented in the future.'

description: ! 'Provides pure functions to compile, decompile and manipulate Bitcoin
  scripts.

  This project relies heavily on the Haskoin project for the compiling and

  decompiling of the script assembly, and continuously merges changes downstream.

  The advantage this library has over Haskoin is that it uses very few

  dependencies and doesn''t rely on external libraries such as LevelDB and snappy.'

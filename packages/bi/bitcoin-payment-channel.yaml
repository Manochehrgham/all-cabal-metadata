description: ! 'A Bitcoin payment channel allows secure and instant transfer of bitcoins
  from one

  party to another. Payments are created and verified in less than a millisecond

  (plus network latency), and cannot be double spent, as the receiver of funds is
  defined

  during channel setup.

  When the channel is closed, the settlement transaction transfers the appropriate
  value to each

  party, thus paying the Bitcoin transaction fee only once, regardless of the number
  of payments

  made over the channel.

  The channel setup procedure is trustless, because the funding party - after the
  chosen

  expiration date - is able to reclaim the bitcoins used to fund the channel,

  in case the receiving party goes missing.

  This library implements a type of payment channel where channel setup

  is safe from transaction ID malleability, and value transfer is uni-directional
  (one party

  sends and the other party receives) (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY-style).'

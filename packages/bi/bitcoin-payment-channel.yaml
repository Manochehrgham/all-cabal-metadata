description: ! 'A Bitcoin payment channel allows two parties two send value to each
  other very rapidly.

  The speed of the value transfer is limited primarily by network latency, and payments

  cannot be double spent, as the receiver of funds is defined during channel setup.

  The channel setup procedure is trustless, in that the funding party is able to retrieve
  the funds,

  after a chosen expiration date, in case the receiving party goes missing.

  This library implements a type of payment channel (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY-style) where
  channel setup

  is safe from transaction ID malleability, and value transfer is uni-directional
  (one party

  sends and the other party receives).'

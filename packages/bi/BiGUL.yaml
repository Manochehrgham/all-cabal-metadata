description: ! 'Putback-based bidirectional programming allows the programmer to

  write only one putback transformation, from which the unique

  corresponding forward transformation is derived for free. BiGUL,

  short for the Bidirectional Generic Update Language, is designed to

  be a minimalist putback-based bidirectional programming language.

  BiGUL was originally developed in the dependently typed programming

  language Agda, and its well-behavedness has been completely formally

  verified; this package is the Haskell port of BiGUL.


  For more detail, see the following paper:

  verified core language for putback-based bidirectional programming.

description: ! 'See the @levmar@ package for a high-level wrapper

  around this package.


  The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative

  technique that finds a local minimum of a function that

  is expressed as the sum of squares of nonlinear

  functions. It has become a standard technique for

  nonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of

  as a combination of steepest descent and the

  Gauss-Newton method. When the current solution is far

  from the correct one, the algorithm behaves like a

  steepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to

  converge. When the current solution is close to the

  correct solution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.


  Both unconstrained and constrained (under linear

  equations and box constraints) Levenberg-Marquardt

  variants are included.  All functions have Double and

  Float variants.


  Note that the included

  <http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/ C library>

  is lightly patched to make it pure. This way the

  functions can be used inside @unsafePerformIO@.


  A note regarding the license:


  All files EXCEPT those in the levmar-2.4 directory fall

  under the BSD3 license. The levmar C library, which is

  bundled with this binding, falls under the GPL. If you

  build a program which is linked with this binding then

  it is also linked with levmar. This means such a

  program can only by distributed under the terms of the

  GPL.'

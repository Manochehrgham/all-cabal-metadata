description: ! 'This is a strict version of the Get monad from the binary

  package. It''s pretty much just a copy and paste job from the

  original source code. The binary team are currently unsure

  about their future plans w.r.t. strictness, so this is just a

  stop gap measure. See

  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/DealingWithBinaryData> for

  documentation.'

description: ! 'Provides import and export facilities for Infernal/Rfam data

  formats. We include Stockholm, CM, verbose Infernal results,

  and tabulated Infernal results. Some small tools are included.


  The VerboseHit format is slightly extended to allow simple

  annotations. This extension should be backward-compatible with

  standard-compliant parsers.


  This package uses Int''s to store sequence position information.

  Don''t compile for 32bit. (And yes, this is a TODO, to change to

  Int64).

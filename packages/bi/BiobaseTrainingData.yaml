description: ! 'Parameter training for RNA secondary structure prediction tools

  requires data to train on. Since there are a number of

  different available formats, and handling them all in the

  training tools is a pain, we have this library and programs.

  "MkTrainingData" transforms different formats and they all

  produce a common "training data" format. This format is

  Haskell-readable (and only partially human-readable)

  line-by-line. Generating additional training data is therefor

  easy as one can just "cat" together different training files.


  Note that several features are designed around /extended/ RNA

  secondary structures.


  Now with some filtering and manipulation options.'

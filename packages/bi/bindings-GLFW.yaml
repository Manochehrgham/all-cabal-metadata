description: ! 'Low-level bindings to GLFW (<http://www.glfw.org/>), an open source,

  multi-platform library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and managing

  input and events.


  The binding is to GLFW 3.1, released 2015-01-18

  (<http://www.glfw.org/Version-3.1-released.html>

  <http://www.glfw.org/changelog.html>).


  /These bindings are too low-level for normal use./ For higher-level bindings,

  see GLFW-b (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW-b>).


  If you''ve used GLFW before, you were probably using 2.7.x. There are some

  significant differences in 3.x.x. Please see the transition guide

  (<http://www.glfw.org/docs/3.1/moving.html>).'

description: ! 'Implementation of lists whose number of elements is a

  power of two. Binary lists have this property by definition,

  so it is impossible to build a value with other kind of length.

  The implementation take advantage of this property to get

  additional performance.


  Some algorithms are designed to work only when the input list

  has length a power of two. Use binary lists to ensure this

  property in the input. In addition, this library exports

  some useful functions for this kind of algorithms. An example

  implementing the Fast Fourier Transform is provided in the

  "Data.BinaryList" module.


  The package contains an additional module with utilities for

  the (de)serialization of binary lists.'

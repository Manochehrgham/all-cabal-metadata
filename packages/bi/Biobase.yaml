description: ! 'Base library for bioinformatics providing the following features:


  RNA sequences and energy files:


  * efficient format for RNA sequences, based on the vector package


  * internal conversion from strings and bytestrings


  * secondary structure manipulation functions, im- and export of Vienna-dotbracket
  notation




  Utility classes:


  * algebraic ring class


  * instances for Gibbs free energy, partition function probabilities, and scores


  * conversion between different entities




  Bioinformatics data sources:


  * mostly just imports, some export functions are provided


  * Fasta (please use the "bio" library by Ketil Malde)


  * Mafft


  * RNA secondary structure: Dot-Bracket, CT


  * ViennaRNA energy files (with default parameters)


  * Turner energy files: cf. <http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/NNDB/index.html>


  * RNAstrand database: dot-parenthesis (one file, many entries)


  * FR3D: basepairs


  * Infernal: covariance models (text-based)


  * MC-Fold: NCM database




  Important notes:


  * In general, this library is not unicode safe (and could somebody tell me the reason
  for encoding DNA/RNA sequences in unicode?)'

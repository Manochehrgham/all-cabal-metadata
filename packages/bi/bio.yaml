description: ! 'This is a collection of data structures and algorithms

  useful for building bioinformatics-related tools

  and utilities.


  Current list of features includes: a Sequence data type supporting

  protein and nucleotide sequences and conversion between them.  As of version

  0.4, different kinds of sequence have different types.  Support for quality

  data, reading and writing Fasta formatted files, reading TwoBit and

  phd formats, and Roche/454 SFF files.  Rudimentary (i.e. unoptimized) support

  for doing alignments - including dynamic adjustment of scores based on sequence
  quality.

  Also Blast output parsing.  Partly implemented single linkage clustering, and

  multiple alignment.  Reading Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (GOA) and

  definitions\/hierarchy.

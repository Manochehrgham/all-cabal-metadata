description: ! 'Binary indexed trees are a data structure on indexes

  1 through n.  They allow you to compute the sum

  of all values at indexes 1 through i in O(logn) and to

  increase the value at index i in O(logn).


  This implements binary indexed trees, both

  as an immutable data structure in pure code

  and as a mutable data structure using the ST Monad.


  Both the immutable and mutable version have the

  same runtime complexity, but the mutable version

  has a smaller constant.

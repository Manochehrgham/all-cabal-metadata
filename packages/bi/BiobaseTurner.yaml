description: ! 'A data structure for Mathews / Turner RNA and DNA energy

  parameters. This library currently only provides an importer,

  not export functions. There are two reasons: (i) We currently

  have no use-case where we need more than import facilities (ii)

  The file structure is geared towards humans, not machines. If

  you need to be able to export, send a mail.


  NOTE This is rather fragile as some files use different index

  enumerations, which we handle rather... simplistically.


  In principle, all parameters should be symmetric regarding the

  stem direction. However, there is one asymmetry case in

  dnastack.dh. We do not fix this problem as we do not change the

  source files.'

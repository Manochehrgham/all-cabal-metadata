description: ! 'DEPRECATED. This library is looking for a new maintainer.


  This library provides low level bindings to the SuperCollider synthesis

  engine library (@libscsynth@). If you are looking for a higher level

  Haskell interface, please use the /hsc3-process/ package

  (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsc3-process>).


  ChangeLog: <https://github.com/kaoskorobase/bindings-sc3/blob/master/ChangeLog.md>


  In order to use this package, you need to build the dynamic library version

  of SuperCollider <supercollider.sourceforge.net> by passing

  @-DLIBSCSYNTH=ON@ to @cmake@ and put it in a location where it can be found by the

  linker (e.g. @/usr/local/lib@ on Unix systems, alternatively use the @--extra-lib-dirs@

  flag of @cabal configure@).


  The required SuperCollider version is 3.5.'

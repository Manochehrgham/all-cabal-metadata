description: ! '__Introduction__


  This package provides varieties of binary search functions.


  These search function can search for predicates of the type

  @pred :: (Integral a, Eq b) => a -> b@, or monadic predicates

  @pred :: (Integral a, Eq b, Monad m) => a -> m b@.

  The predicates must satisfy that the domain range for any codomain value

  is continuous; that is, @∀x≦y≦z. pred x == pred z ⇒ pred y == pred x@ .


  For example, we can address the problem of finding the boundary

  of an upward-closed set of integers, using a combination

  of exponential and binary searches.


  Variants are provided

  for searching within bounded and unbounded intervals of

  both ''Integer'' and bounded integral types.


  The package was created by Ross Paterson, and extended

  by Takayuki Muranushi, to be used together with SMT solvers.


  __The Module Structure__


  *  "Numeric.Search.Combinator.Monadic" provides the most generic combinators. "Numeric.Search.Combinator.Pure"
  provides the pure version of them.

  *  "Numeric.Search" exports both pure and monadic version.

  *  "Numeric.Search.Bounded" ,  "Numeric.Search.Integer" ,  "Numeric.Search.Range"
  provides the various specialized searchers, which means less number of function
  arguments, and easier to use.

description: ! 'Conduit-based handling of FASTA files. This library provides a

  streaming interface. The user selects a window size, then

  handles the window. For each window, the previous (past) window

  is available, in case some data sits on the boundary between

  windows.


  FastaTool is a simple tool providing information on FASTA

  files, and allowing to extract sequences and subsequences.


  The library is, in general, in a "preview" state. In cases

  where you need to scan large FASTA files fast and with low

  memory overhead, the ''streamFasta'' function, however, should

  already be useable enough.'

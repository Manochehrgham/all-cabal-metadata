description: ! 'Tagchup is a package for processing XML, HTML, XHTML documents

  that can also be malformed.

  It allows parsing, formatting and retrieval of such document.

  All functions should be as lazy as possible.


  I use a custom data structure based on types from xml-basic

  for easy interchange with the wraxml package.


  Its lazy monadic parser should be more comprehensible and easier to extend

  than the one of tagsoup-0.6.

  It also handles XML processing instructions and CDATA sections correctly.


  The name Tagchup resembles Ketchup.'

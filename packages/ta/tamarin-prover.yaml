description: ! 'The Tamarin prover is a tool for the analysis of security protocols.
  It

  implements a constraint solving algorithm that supports both falsification

  and verification of security protocols with respect to an unbounded number

  of sessions. The underlying security protocol model uses multiset

  rewriting to specify protocols and adversary capabilities, a guarded

  fragment of first-order logic to specify security properties, and

  equational theories to model the algebraic properties of cryptographic

  operators.


  The paper describing the theory underlying the Tamarin prover was

  accepted at CSF 2012. Its extended version is available from

  <http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/research/software/tamarin>.


  The Tamarin prover supports both a batch analysis mode and the

  interactive construction of security proofs using a GUI. Example protocols

  and the user guide are installed together with the prover. Just call the

  @tamarin-prover@ executable without any arguments to get more information.


  The Tamarin prover uses maude (<http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/>) as a

  unification backend and GraphViz (<http://www.graphviz.org/>) to visualize

  constraint systems. Detailed instructions for installing the Tamarin

  prover are given at <http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/research/software/tamarin>.'

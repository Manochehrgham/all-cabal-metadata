description: ! 'Takusen-Oracle is a Oracle access library. Like HSQL and HDBC, we
  support

  arbitrary SQL statements (currently strings, extensible to anything

  that can be converted to a string).

  It is based on original Takusen library. It was just upgraded to support

  Oracle 11gR2/12c instant client and GHC 7.4.2 and higher.'

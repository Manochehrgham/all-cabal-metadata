description: ! 'Tabular provides a Haskell representation of two-dimensional

  data tables, the kind that you might find in a spreadsheet or

  or a research report.  It also comes with some default

  rendering functions for turning those tables into ASCII art,

  simple text with an arbitrary delimiter, CSV, HTML or LaTeX.


  Below is an example of the kind of output this library produces.

  The tabular package can group rows and columns, each group

  having one of three separators (no line, single line, double line)

  between its members.


  >     || memtest 1 | memtest 2 ||  time test  | time test 2

  > ====++===========+===========++=============+============

  > A 1 ||       hog |  terrible ||        slow |      slower

  > A 2 ||       pig |   not bad ||        fast |     slowest

  > ----++-----------+-----------++-------------+------------

  > B 1 ||      good |     awful || intolerable |    bearable

  > B 2 ||    better | no chance ||    crawling |     amazing

  > B 3 ||       meh |   well... ||  worst ever |          ok'

description: ! '`table-layout` is a library for text-based table layout, it provides
  several

  functions and types which help in this task from the ground up, although

  using them is not necessary. It provides the following layout features:


  * Fixed-size and arbitrarily sized columns and limiting versions of those


  * Positional alignment of content in a column


  * Alignment of content within a column at a character occurence


  * Cut marks show that content has been trimmed


  * Fancy tables with optional headers and user styles


  * Justified text layout over multiple rows

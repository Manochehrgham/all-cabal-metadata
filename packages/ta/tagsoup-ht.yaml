description: ! 'TagSoup is a package for parsing and extracting information from (possibly
  malformed) HTML/XHTML documents.

  Here I present my own parser,

  which I find (of course) more comprehensible and easier to extend.

  It also handles XML declarations and CDATA sections correctly.

  This package is abandoned and will be renamed to Tagchup.'

synopsis: A desktop bar similar to xmobar, but with more GUI
changelog: ! "# 0.4.5\n\n * GHC 7.10 compat\n\n# 0.4.4\n\n * Fix compilation with
  gtk 0.13.1\n\n# 0.4.3\n\n * Try again to fix the network dependency\n\n# 0.4.2\n\n
  * Expand the version range for time\n * Depend on network-uri instead of network\n\n#
  0.4.1\n\n * Make the clock react to time zone changes\n\n# 0.4.0\n\n## Features\n\n
  * Resize the bar when the screen configuration changes (Robert Helgesson)\n * Support
  bypassing `dyre` by exposing `taffybarMain` (Christian Hoener zu Siederdissen)\n
  * Textual CPU and memory monitors (Zakhar Voit)\n * A new window switcher menu in
  the pager (José Alfredo Romero L)\n * Dynamic workspace support in the workspace
  switcher (Nick Hu)\n * More configurable network monitor (Arseniy Seroka)\n * New
  widget: text-based command runner (Arseniy Seroka)\n * The Graph widget supports
  lines graphs (via graphDataStyles) (Joachim Breitner)\n * Compile with gtk2hs 0.13\n\n##
  Bug Fixes\n\n * Reduce wakeups by tweaking the default GHC RTS options (Joachim
  Breitner)\n * UTF8 fixes (Nathan Maxson)\n * Various fixes to EWMH support (José
  Alfredo Romero L)\n\n## Deprecations\n\nThe `XMonadLog` module is deprecated.  This
  module let taffybar display XMonad desktop information through a dbus connection.
  \ The EWMH desktop support by José Alfredo Romero L is better in every way, so that
  (through TaffyPager) is the recommended replacement.  Upgrading should be straightforward.\n\n\n#
  0.3.0:\n\n * A new pager (System.Taffybar.TaffyPager) from José A. Romero L.  This
  pager is a drop-in replacement for the dbus-based XMonadLog widget.  It communicates
  via X atoms and EWMH like a real pager.  It even supports changing workspaces by
  clicking on them.  I recommend this over the old widget.\n * Added an MPRIS2 widget
  (contributed by Igor Babuschkin)\n * Ported to use the newer merged dbus library
  instead of dbus-client/dbus-core (contributed by CJ van den Berg)\n * Finally have
  the calendar widget pop up over the date/time widget (contributed by José A. Romero)\n
  * GHC 7.6 compatibility\n * Vertical bars can now have dynamic background colors
  (suggested by Elliot Wolk)\n * Bug fixes\n\n# 0.2.1:\n\n * More robust strut handling
  for multiple monitors of different sizes (contributed by Morgan Gibson)\n * New
  widgets from José A. Romero (network monitor, fs monitor, another CPU monitor)\n
  * Allow the bar widget to grow vertically (also contributed by José A. Romero)\n\n#
  0.2.0:\n\n * Add some more flexible formatting options for the XMonadLog widget
  (contributed by cnervi).\n * Make the PollingLabel more robust with an exception
  handler for IOExceptions\n * Added more documentation for a few widgets\n\n# 0.1.3:\n\n
  * Depend on gtk 0.12.1+ to be able to build under ghc 7.2\n * Fix the background
  colors in the calendar so that it follows the GTK theme instead of the bar-specific
  color settings\n * Fix the display of non-ASCII window titles in the XMonad log
  applet (assuming you use the dbusLog function)\n * Add a horrible hack to force
  the bar to not resize to be larger than the screen due to notifications or long
  window titles\n\n# 0.1.2:\n\n * Readable widget for freedesktop notifications\n
  * Fixed a few potential deadlocks on startup\n * Use the GTK+ rc-file styling system
  for colors instead of hard coding them\n"

description: ! "This is a desktop information bar intended for use with XMonad and\nsimilar
  window managers.  It is similar in spirit to xmobar; it is\ndifferent in that it
  gives up some simplicity for a reasonable helping\nof eye candy.  This bar is based
  on GTK+ (via gtk2hs) and uses fancy\ngraphics where doing so is reasonable and useful.
  \ Example:\n\n![](https://github.com/travitch/taffybar/blob/master/doc/screenshot.png)\n\nThe
  bar is configured much like XMonad.  It uses\n~/.config/taffybar/taffybar.hs as
  its configuration file.  This file\nis just a Haskell program that invokes the real
  _main_ function with a\nconfiguration object.  The configuration file basically
  just specifies\nwhich widgets to use, though any arbitrary Haskell code can be\nexecuted
  before the bar is created.\n\nThere are some generic pre-defined widgets available:\n\n
  * Graph (modeled after the graph widget in Awesome)\n * Vertical bar (also similar
  to a widget in Awesome)\n * Periodically-updating labels, graphs, and vertical bars\n\nThere
  are also several more specialized widgets:\n\n * Battery widget\n * Textual clock\n
  * Freedesktop.org notifications (via dbus)\n * MPRIS1 and MPRIS2 widgets\n * Weather
  widget\n * XMonad log widget (listens on dbus instead of stdin)\n * System tray\n\nTODO\n====\n\nAn
  incomplete list of things that would be cool to have:\n\n * xrandr widget (for dealing
  changing clone/extend mode and orientation)\n * Better behavior when adding/removing
  monitors (never tried it)\n * Make MPRIS more configurable\n"

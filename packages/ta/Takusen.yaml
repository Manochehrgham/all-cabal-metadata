description: ! 'Takusen is a DBMS access library. Like HSQL and HDBC, we support

  arbitrary SQL statements (currently strings, extensible to anything

  that can be converted to a string).


  Takusen''s unique selling point is safety and efficiency.

  We statically ensure all acquired database resources - such

  as cursors, connections, and statement handles - are released, exactly

  once, at predictable times. Takusen can avoid loading the whole result

  set in memory, and so can handle queries returning millions of rows in

  constant space. Takusen also supports automatic marshalling and

  unmarshalling of results and query parameters. These benefits come

  from the design of query result processing around a left-fold

  enumerator.


  Currently we fully support ODBC, Oracle, Sqlite, and PostgreSQL.'

description: ! 'A Tardis is a combination of both a forwards and a backwards

  state transformer, providing two state values that \"travel\"

  in opposite directions.


  You can install this library with the @use-undecidable-instances@ flag,

  but this feature is only provided for toying around.

  If you depend on this library, or install any libraries that

  depend on this library, then you should install this library /without/

  that flag.


  A detailed description of what a Tardis is and how to use it

  can be found in the documentation for Control.Monad.Tardis.'

description: ! 'TagSoup is a library for parsing HTML/XML. It supports the HTML 5
  specification,

  and can be used to parse either well-formed XML, or unstructured and malformed HTML

  from the web. The library also provides useful functions to extract information

  from an HTML document, making it ideal for screen-scraping.


  Users should start from the "Text.HTML.TagSoup" module.'

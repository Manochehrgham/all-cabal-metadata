description: ! 'This library is for working with \"@.tar@\" archive files. It

  can read and write a range of common variations of archive

  format including V7, USTAR, POSIX and GNU formats. It provides

  support for packing and unpacking portable archives. This

  makes it suitable for distribution but not backup because

  details like file ownership and exact permissions are not

  preserved.'

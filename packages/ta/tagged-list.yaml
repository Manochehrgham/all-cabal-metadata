description: ! 'This package contains a datatype, ''TaggedList'', that provides a
  fixed-length list

  tagged with a phantom type-level natural number that corresponds to the length of

  the list.  It also contains some basic operations on these lists, as well as a

  typeclass for converting tagged lists to and from tuples.


  New in version 1.1:  added function castTag, improved error reporting in fromList,

  and fixed compiler error with GHC 7.0.*'

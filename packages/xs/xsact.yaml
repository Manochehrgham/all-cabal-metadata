description: ! 'Xsact is an EST clustering program with a variety of output options.

  This package exposes the internal libraries, and provides 4 binaries:


  * xsact; implements a complete multiple-matching clustering algorithm.

  * xplit; This implements a simple splitter for xsact''s UniGene-formatted files.

  Useful if you want to run an assembler on individual clusters.

  * xtract; the eXperimental TRanscript

  Assembly/Consensus Tool.  The idea is to construct the splice graph

  from each EST cluster in the input, by first constructing and then

  traversing the de Bruijn graph of $k-1$-words.'

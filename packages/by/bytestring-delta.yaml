description: ! 'Compute a patch between two ByteStrings which can later be applied
  to the

  first to produce the second.  This can be used to save bandwidth and disk

  space when many strings differing by a small number of bytes need to be

  transmitted or stored.


  The underlying implementation is written in C, and can also be found at

  <http://ccodearchive.net/info/bdelta.html>.


  Currently, a patch does not save any space when two strings differ by

  more than 1000 bytes.  This arbitrary limit serves to keep applications

  from spiking in memory and CPU usage, as the algorithm uses quadratic

  space and time with respect to the length of the patch.  A better

  algorithm may be introduced in a future version of bytestring-delta.'

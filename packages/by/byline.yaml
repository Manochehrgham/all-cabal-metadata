description: ! '# Byline


  Byline simplifies writing interactive terminal applications by

  building upon [ansi-terminal][] and [haskeline][]. This makes it

  possible to print messages and prompts that include terminal escape

  sequences such as colors that are automatically disabled when standard

  input is a file. It also means that Byline works on both

  POSIX-compatible systems and on Windows.


  The primary features of Byline include printing messages, prompting

  for input, and generating custom menus. It was inspired by the

  [highline] Ruby library and the [terminal library][] by Craig Roche.

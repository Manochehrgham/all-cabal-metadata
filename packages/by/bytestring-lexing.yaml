description: ! "bytestring-lexing\n=================\n\nThis is a relatively simple
  package and should be easy to install.\nIt requires Alex for generating the Double
  lexers. Once that is\ninstalled, you should be able to use one of the following
  standard\nmethods to install it.\n\n    -- With cabal-install and without the source:\n
  \   $> cabal install bytestring-lexing\n    \n    -- With cabal-install and with
  the source already:\n    $> cd bytestring-lexing\n    $> cabal install\n    \n    --
  Without cabal-install, but with the source already:\n    $> cd bytestring-lexing\n
  \   $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build\n
  \   $> runhaskell Setup.hs test\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source\n
  \   $> runhaskell Setup.hs copy\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register\n\nThe test
  step is optional and currently does nothing. The Haddock\nstep is also optional.\n\n\nPortability\n===========\n\nAn
  attempt has been made to keep this library portable. However,\nit relies on some
  language extensions which have been accepted into\nthe Haskell standard following
  the Haskell98 report. All the required\nlanguage extensions are:\n\nFFI\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------

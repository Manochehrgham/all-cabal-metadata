description: ! 'More compact representation for strict ''ByteString''s avoiding the

  overhead and indirection caused by ''ForeignPtr''.


  This representation is useful to reduce the incurred memory overhead

  when operating with many small, long-lived, distinct byte strings

  (such as keys for containers).


  See documentation in "Data.ByteString.Plain" for more details about

  this representation.


  As an alternative, recent `bytestring` versions provide

  "Data.ByteString.Short" which has a similiar overhead but uses unpinned

  memory instead (and thus requires an additional string data copy in

  contrast to "Data.ByteString.Plain" which allows to share the string data

  with the associated "Data.ByteString" value).'

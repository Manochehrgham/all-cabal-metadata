description: ! 'This is a library of parser combinators, originally written by Koen
  Claessen.

  It parses all alternatives in parallel, so it never keeps hold of

  the beginning of the input string, a common source of space leaks with

  other parsers.  The ''(+++)'' choice combinator is genuinely commutative;

  it makes no difference which branch is \"shorter\".


  Adapted to use Data.ByteString by Gracjan Polak. Designed as a drop-in

  replacement for Text.ParserCombinators.ReadP.'

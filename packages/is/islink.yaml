description: ! 'This package provides a function that checks whether a particular

  combination of an HTML tag name and an attribute corresponds to an HTML

  element that links to an external resource. For example, the combination

  of the tag @img@ and the attribute @src@ is an external link whereas

  the combination @div@ and @style@ is not. This is particularly useful

  for web scraping.'

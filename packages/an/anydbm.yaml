description: ! 'This module provides a generic infrastructure for supporting storage

  of hash-like items with String-to-String mappings.  It can be used

  for in-memory or on-disk storage.


  Two simple backend drivers are included with this package: one

  that is RAM-only, and one that is persistent and disk-backed.

  The hdbc-anydbm package provides another driver, which lets you use

  simple tables in any SQL database to provide a DBM-like interface.

  MissingPy also provides a Python driver which lets you use any

  Python anydbm driver under Haskell AnyDBM.'

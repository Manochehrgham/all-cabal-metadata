description: ! 'A combinator library to improve the building of anti-quoters.

  Especially aimed at removing copy-and-paste programming from

  their definition. Other antiquoting related features could be

  included in the future.


  The modules are


  * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Base" basic types for building

  antiquoters. It also contains the most detailed example of

  the basic usage.


  * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat" making antiquoters which

  can antiquote both expressions and patters. Therefore only

  one antiquoter has to be defined in stead of two.


  * "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.Combinators" more useful

  combinators to use with the functions from

  "Language.Haskell.AntiQuoter.ExpPat".'

description: ! 'Anansi is a preprocessor for literate programs, in the model of NoWeb
  or

  nuweb. Literate programming allows computer code and a human-readable

  document to be generated from the same source. Compared to NoWeb,

  Anansi&#x2019;s primary benefits are the ability to include separate files,

  and to automatically generate an entire directory tree from a project

  without having to enumerate each output.


  This package is split into a library and an executable. The executable is

  suitable for simple cases, such as generating basic HTML or LaTeX. The

  library is useful for users who would like to write their own output formats

  (called &#x201C;looms&#x201D;).'

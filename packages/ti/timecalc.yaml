description: ! 'TimeCalc is a very simple utility for calculating times. I use it
  for calculating splits or predicting race times. It is a calculator that supports
  doubles and times. For example:


  If I run 5 kilometers at 3:30/kilometer, the race will take me 17:30.


  > 5*3:30

  > 17:30


  If I want to know how fast my splits need to be in order to run a 10K in 37:00.


  > 37:00/10

  > 3:42


  If I want to add two times:


  > 3:42 + 3:30 + 3:49

  > 11:01


  Or calculating the splits Bekele needs to run on the marathon:


  > 2:02:13 / 42.195

  > 2:54


  Which is very fast, indeed.'

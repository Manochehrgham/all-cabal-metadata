description: ! "timerep\n=======\n\nThis started out as a simple project to parse
  and display time according to\n[RFC 3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339), but
  with time gained ability\nto convert to and from other RFCs as well.\n\nYou will
  find a change log in `CHANGES.md`.\n\n\n### Todos\n\n- Get rid of the `formatTime`
  function, and use a more decent pretty\n  printing lib.\n- Do some proper parsing
  (it parses nicely, but this was just a quick hack\n  that my mind produced while
  being stressed to finish this).\n\n\n### License\n\nThis project is licensed under
  a 3-clause BSD license as specified in the\n`LICENSE` file.\n"

description: ! 'TinyMesh are modules build on CC11xx TI MCU transceivers

  that allow for automatic meshing, and remote sensor reading.


  Whole sensor network may be orchestrated by a single *gateway*

  machine that is best connected to internet in order

  to submit the data to the cloud.


  This library is aimed to allow programming such a gateway machine

  in Haskell, so that it may be Raspberry Pi, or a similar networked

  ARM device.


  Current functionality of the module is limited to querying

  all the nodes within the mesh.'

description: ! 'Substitution tilings.  The term substitution, in connection with tilings,

  describes a simple but powerful method to produce tilings with many

  interesting properties.


  The main idea is to use a finite set of building blocks called prototiles,

  an expanding linear map (the inflation factor), and a rule how to dissect

  each scaled tile into copies of the original prototiles.


  For some examples of substitution tilings, and a glossary of terminology,

  see the /tilings encyclopedia/

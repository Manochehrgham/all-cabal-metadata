description: ! 'In many cases, it is useful (either for error checking or documentation

  reasons) to define input and output types as having a particular unit of

  time. In addition, by creating a type class defining type units, this

  library should make it easier to separate the units of time the developer

  wants to think in versus the units of time the library author wants to

  think in.'

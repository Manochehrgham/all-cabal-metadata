description: ! 'Following the convention the @abstract-par@ package,

  this package simply defines an interface, in the form of a

  type class, and does not contain any implementation.

  Importing this module gives the user an API to

  access @Accelerate@ computations from within

  @Par@ computations, with the added benefit that

  the @Par@ can do integrated CPU/GPU scheduling.'

description: ! 'For end to end testing of web applications from Haskell, the

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webdriver webdriver> package is a great tool
  but

  does not provide specific commands to make testing a webpage using

  <http://angularjs.org/ AngularJS> easier.  The

  <https://github.com/angular/protractor protractor> project provides Angular-specific

  webdriver commands but the test code must be written in javascript.  This package

  fills the gap by reusing some of the protractor code to allow end to end tests of
  Angular

  applications to be written in Haskell.'

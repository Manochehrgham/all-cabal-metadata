description: ! 'This package provides very simplistic wrappers to enable running code
  using the Snap and Happstack web frameworks on the FP Complete environment. The
  only modification to standard behavior is that the port number is read from the
  PORT environment variable as opposed to being specified on either the command line
  or in the code itself. If you''re using Yesod, the function warpEnv is provided
  in the Yesod module itself, which performs the same function.


  For the most part, it should be sufficient to import the relevant module from this
  package in place of the standard module, e.g. import @Snap.Http.Server.Env@ instead
  of @Snap.Http.Server@, or @Happstack.Server.Env@ instead of @Happstack.Server@.'

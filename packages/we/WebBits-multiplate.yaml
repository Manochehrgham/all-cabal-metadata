description: ! 'Provides a Multiplate instance for the JavaScript AST in the WebBits
  package.

  The MultiplateSimplified module is based on the multiplate-simplified package,

  which makes it a bit more readable, and easier to work with

  but the extra type class it uses might affect performance.'

  game engine for playing werewolf within a chat client.\nThis engine is based off
  of the party game Mafia, also known as Werewolf.\nSee the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game))
  for a rundown on it's\n    gameplay and history.\n\nIf you're here just to play
  werewolf, you may wish to skip straight to\n    [chat interfaces](https://github.com/hjwylde/werewolf#chat-interfaces).\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nI
  recently asked the copyright owners of the Werewolves of Millers Hollow if I may
  have permission\n    to use some content from the rule book, but they have said
  no.\nI am currently working on removing all copyrighted material from the project.\n\n###
  Game description\n\nLong has the woods been home to wild creatures, both kind and
  cruel.\nMost have faces and are known to the inhabitants of Fougères in Brittany,
  France; but no-one from\n    the village has yet to lay eyes on the merciless Werewolf.\n\nEach
  night Werewolves attack the village and devour the innocent.\nFor centuries no one
  knew how to fight this scourge, however recently a theory has taken ahold that\n
  \   mayhaps the Werewolves walk among the Villagers themselves...\n\nObjective of
  the Game:  \nFor the Loners: complete their own objective.  \nFor the Villagers:
  lynch all of the Werewolves.  \nFor the Werewolves: devour all of the Villagers.\n\n####
  Roles\n\nThe implemented roles are split into four categories.\n\n**The Ambiguous:**\n\nNo-one
  knows the true nature of the Ambiguous, sometimes not even the Ambiguous themselves!\n\nThe
  Ambiguous are able to change allegiance throughout the game.\n\n* Devoted Servant\n*
  Wild-child\n* Wolf-hound\n\n**The Loners:**\n\nThe Loners look out for themselves
  and themselves alone.\n\nThe Loners must complete their own objective.\n\n* Angel\n\n**The
  Villagers:**\n\nFraught with fear of the unseen enemy, the Villagers must work together
  to determine the truth and\n    eliminate the threat to Fougères.\nThe task before
  them will not be easy, but a certain few have learnt some tricks over the years
  that\n    may turn out rather useful.\n\nThe Villagers must lynch all of the Werewolves.\n\n*
  Defender\n* Druid\n* Jester\n* Scapegoat\n* Seer\n* Simple Villager\n* Villager-Villager\n*
  Witch\n\n**The Werewolves:**\n\nHiding in plain sight, the Werewolves are not a
  small trifle.\n\nThe Werewolves must devour all of the Villagers.\n\n* Simple Werewolf\n\n###
  Installing\n\nInstalling werewolf is easiest done using either\n    [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack)
  (recommended) or\n    [Cabal](https://github.com/haskell/cabal).\n\n**Using stack:**\n\n```bash\nstack
  install werewolf\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin\n```\n\n**Using Cabal:**\n\n```bash\ncabal-install
  werewolf\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.cabal/bin\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nThis section covers
  how a chat interface interacts with the werewolf game engine.\n\nAll werewolf commands
  are designed to be run by a user from the chat client.\nE.g., to start a game:\n\n```bash\n>
  werewolf --caller @foo start --extra-roles seer @bar @baz @qux @quux @corge @grault\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[\n
  \   {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"A new game of werewolf is starting with @foo, @bar,
  @baz, @qux, @quux, @corge, @grault!\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"The roles
  in play are Seer (1), Simple Villager (4), Simple Werewolf (2) for a total balance
  of -2.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@foo\",\"message\":\"You're a Simple Villager.\\nA simple,
  ordinary townsperson in every way. Their only weapons are the ability to analyze
  behaviour to identify Werewolves, and the strength of their conviction to prevent
  the execution of the innocents like themselves.\"},\n    ...,\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"Night
  falls, the village is asleep.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"The Seer wakes
  up.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@corge\",\"message\":\"Whose allegiance would you like to
  `see`?\"}\n    ]}\n```\n\nIn this example, user _@foo_ ran the `start` command with
  the player names as arguments.\nNote that the calling user, _@foo_ was passed in
  to the `--caller` option.\nAll commands require this option.\n\nAny command ran
  returns a JSON result.\nThe result contains a boolean for whether the command was
  successful and a list of messages.\nThe `to` header on a message may either be `null`---for
  a public message---or have an intended\n    recipient.\n\nIt's the Seer's turn now.\n\n```bash\n>
  werewolf --caller @corge see @grault\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[\n    {\"to\":\"@corge\",\"message\":\"@grault
  is aligned with the Werewolves.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@quux\",\"message\":\"You feel
  restless, like an old curse is keeping you from sleep. It seems you're not the only
  one... @grault are also emerging from their homes.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@grault\",\"message\":\"You
  feel restless, like an old curse is keeping you from sleep.  It seems you're not
  the only one... @quux are also emerging from their homes.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"The
  Werewolves wake up, recognise one another and choose a new victim.\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@quux\",\"message\":\"Whom
  would you like to `vote` to devour?\"},\n    {\"to\":\"@grault\",\"message\":\"Whom
  would you like to `vote` to devour?\"}\n    ]}\n```\n\nLet's have the Werewolves,
  _@quux_ and _@grault_, vote to devour a Villager.\n\n```bash\n> werewolf --caller
  @quux vote @foo\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[\n    {\"to\":\"@grault\",\"message\":\"@quux
  voted to devour @foo.\"}\n    ]}\n> werewolf --caller @grault vote @foo\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[\n
  \   {\"to\":\"@quux\",\"message\":\"@grault voted to devour @foo.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"The
  sun rises. Everybody wakes up and opens their eyes...\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"As
  you open them you notice a door broken down and @foo's guts half devoured and spilling
  out over the cobblestones. From the look of their personal effects, you deduce they
  were a Simple Villager.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"As the village gathers
  in the square the town clerk calls for a vote.\"},\n    {\"to\":null,\"message\":\"Whom
  would you like to `vote` to lynch?\"}\n    ]}\n```\n\nToo bad for _@foo_. Maybe
  the village can get some vengeance...\n\n```bash\n> werewolf --caller @corge vote
  @grault\n{\"ok\":true,\"messages\":[]}\n```\n\nThis time, even though the command
  was successful, there are no messages.\n\n```bash\n> werewolf --caller @corge vote
  @grault\n{\"ok\":false,\"messages\":[{\"to\":\"@corge\",\"message\":\"You've already
  voted!\"}]}\n```\n\nHere the command was unsuccessful and an error message is sent
  to _@corge_.\nEven though the command was unsuccessful, the chat interface probably
  won't need to do anything\n    special.\nRelaying the error message back to the
  user should suffice.\n\nThus a chat interface must implement the following:\n* The
  ability to call werewolf commands. This includes passing the `--caller` option and
  arguments\n  correctly. It is possible to only implement the `interpret` command,
  which interprets the\n  caller's input.\n* The ability to send resultant messages.
  Resultant messages may be to everyone or to a specific\n  user.\n\n#### Commands\n\nSee
  `werewolf --help`.\n\n#### Chat interfaces\n\nClick through for instructions on
  how to run a chat interface and play werewolf.\n\n* [Slack](https://github.com/hjwylde/werewolf-slack)\n"

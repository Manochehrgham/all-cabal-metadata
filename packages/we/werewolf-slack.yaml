  Slack chat client for playing [werewolf](https://github.com/hjwylde/werewolf).\nThe
  game engine is based off of the party game Mafia, also known as Werewolf.\nSee the
  [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) for a rundown
  on it's\n    gameplay and history.\n\n### Game description\n\nLong has the woods
  been home to wild creatures, both kind and cruel.\nMost have faces and are known
  to the inhabitants of FougÃ¨res in Brittany, France; but no-one from\n    the village
  has yet to lay eyes on the merciless Werewolf.\n\nEach night Werewolves attack the
  village and devour the innocent.\nFor centuries no one knew how to fight this scourge,
  however recently a theory has taken ahold\n    that\n    maphaps the Werewolves
  walk among the Villagers themselves...\n\nObjective of the Game:  \nFor the Loners:
  complete their own objective.  \nFor the Villagers: lynch all of the Werewolves.
  \ \nFor the Werewolves: devour all of the Villagers.\n\n### Installing\n\nInstalling

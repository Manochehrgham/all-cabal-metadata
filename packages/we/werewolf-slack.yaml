description: ! "# werewolf-slack\n\n[![Project Status: Wip - Initial development is
  in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the
  public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)\n[![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/hjwylde/werewolf-slack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hjwylde/werewolf-slack)\n[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/hjwylde/werewolf-slack.svg)](https://github.com/hjwylde/werewolf-slack/releases/latest)\n\nA
  chat interface for playing [werewolf](https://github.com/hjwylde/werewolf) in\n
  \   [Slack](https://slack.com/).\nThe game engine is based off of the party game
  Mafia, also known as Werewolf.\nSee the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game))
  for a rundown on it's\n    gameplay and history.\n\n### Game description\n\nLong
  has the woods been home to wild creatures, both kind and cruel.\nMost have faces
  and are known to the inhabitants of FougÃ¨res in Brittany, France; but no-one from\n
  \   the village has yet to lay eyes on the merciless Werewolf.\n\nEach night Werewolves
  attack the village and devour the innocent.\nFor centuries no one knew how to fight
  this scourge, however recently a theory has taken ahold\n    that\n    mayhaps the
  Werewolves walk among the Villagers themselves...\n\nObjective of the Game:  \nFor
  the Loners: complete their own objective.  \nFor the Villagers: lynch all of the
  Werewolves.  \nFor the Werewolves: devour all of the Villagers.\n\n### Setup\n\n####
  Preparing Slack\n\nSet up an Incoming WebHook [here](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/).\nMake
  note of the *access token*, we'll be using that soon.\n\nSet up a Slash Command
  (`/werewolf` or similar)\n    [here](https://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands/).\nThe
  Slash Command should perform a GET request to the server werewolf-slack is going
  to be hosted\n    on.\nMake note of the *validation token* here too.\n\n#### Installing\n\nInstalling
  werewolf-slack is easiest done using either\n    [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  (recommended),\n    [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) or\n    [Cabal](https://github.com/haskell/cabal).\n\n**Using
  Docker:**\n\n```bash\ndocker pull hjwylde/werewolf-slack\n```\n\n**Using stack:**\n\n```bash\nstack
  install werewolf-slack werewolf\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin\n```\n\n**Using
  Cabal:**\n\n```bash\ncabal-install werewolf-slack werewolf\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/.cabal/bin\n```\n\n####
  Running\n\nwerewolf-slack is a simple web server that listens for events from the
  Slack Slash Command.\nAfter receiving an event werewolf-slack forwards it on to
  the werewolf game engine and uses the\n    Incoming WebHook to send back the response.\n\nRunning
  werewolf-slack is easiest done using either\n    [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  (recommended) or\n    the binary itself.\nMake sure to add rules to your firewall
  for werewolf-slack's port.\n\n**With Docker:**\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 80:8080
  hjwylde/werewolf-slack -t ACCESS_TOKEN -v VALIDATION_TOKEN\n```\n\n**With werewolf-slack:**\n\n```bash\nwerewolf-slack
  -p 80 -t ACCESS_TOKEN -v VALIDATION_TOKEN &\n```\n\n#### Configuration\n\nIt is
  possible to also configure the channel to play werewolf in and the port that werewolf-slack\n
  \   listens on.\nThis is done via the `--channel-name` (`-c`) and `--port` (`-p`)
  options respectively.\n\nBy default the channel name is *werewolf* and port *8080*.\n\n###
  Usage\n\nType `/werewolf help` in your Slack channel to get going!\n"

description: ! 'This package combines blaze-html, clay and jmacro into a

  framework-agnostic library to generate web pages dynamically from

  individual components.  It is inspired by Yesod''s widgets, but is

  more general, more powerful and can be used with other web

  frameworks.


  See the @README.md@ file for a full list of features and a quick

  introduction.  More detailed documentation can be found in the

  individual modules.'

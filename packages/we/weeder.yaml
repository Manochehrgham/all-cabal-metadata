  The principle is to delete dead code (pulling up the weeds). To do that, run:


  * GHC with `-fwarn-unused-binds -fwarn-unused-imports`, which finds unused definitions
  and unused imports.

  * [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint#readme), looking for "Redundant extension"
  hints, which finds unused extensions.

  * This tool, `weeder .` which detects redundant `build-depends` in the `.cabal`
  and functions that are exported internally but not available outside this library.


  To use `weeder` your code must be building with `stack`, as it piggy-backs off some
  files `stack` generates. If you don''t normally build with `stack` a simple `stack
  init && weeder . --build` is likely to be sufficient.

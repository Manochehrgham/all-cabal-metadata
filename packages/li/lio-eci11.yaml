description: ! 'A package that provides dynamic tracking of information-flow. This
  package is intended to only be used at the computer science school ECI 2011 (Buenos
  Aires, Argentina) <http://www.dc.uba.ar/events/eci/2011/index_html>. Please, refer
  to the official version of this package if you intended to use it for other purposes.  The
  /Labeled IO/ (LIO) library provides information flow

  control for incorporating untrusted code within Haskell

  applications.  Most code should import module "LIO.LIO" and

  whichever label type the application is using (e.g.,

  "LIO.DCLabel").  The core functionality of the library is

  documented in "LIO.TCB".  LIO was implemented by David

  Mazieres (<http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/>), Deian Stefan

  (<http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/>), Alejandro Russo

  (<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/>) and John C. Mitchell

  (<http://www.stanford.edu/~jcm/>).

  The extended version of our paper, that includes the proofs

  is available here:

  <http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/lio/extended.pdf>.

  To obtain the latest experimental source code, run:

  @git clone http:\/\/www.scs.stanford.edu\/~dm\/repos\/lio.git@'

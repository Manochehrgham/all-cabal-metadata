description: ! 'Low-level FFI bindings to the <http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/
  libconfig>

  configuration file library.


  This library only binds to version 1.4.9 of the libconfig

  library, which is known as @libconfig9@ in Debian-like

  distributions, including Ubuntu.  It will not work with

  older versions of libconfig, including the @libconfig8@

  distributed in Ubuntu 12.04.


  See below for several flags you can use to reduce

  dependencies if this is a problem for you.  If you disable

  everything, this package will only depend on

  @transformers@, @text@, @hashable@ and @deepseq@.'

  Bindings to [libnotify](https://developer.gnome.org/libnotify/) library


  Note that although the bindings are distributed under MIT license *everything* else
  is GPLed.

  And by everything I mean everything: glib, libnotify, haskell bindings to glib,
  and so forth.

  That effectively means that by using libnotify bindings you agree your project is
  GPLed too.

  Sorry about that!

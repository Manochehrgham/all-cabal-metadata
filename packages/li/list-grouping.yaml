description: ! 'Functions for grouping a list into sublists based on predicate or
  integer offsets.


  NOTE: THIS MODULE IS DEPRECATED. PLEASE TRY THE ''split'' PACKAGE INSTEAD

  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/split-0.1.3


  Grouping a list based on integer offsets:


  > splitEvery 3 [1..10]  ==  [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[10]]

  > splitWith [1,3,1,3] [1..10]  ==  [[1],[2,3,4],[5],[6,7,8],[9,10]]

  > splitWithDrop [1,3,1,3] [1..10]  ==  [[1],[2,3,4],[5],[6,7,8]]


  Grouping based on a predicate:


  > breakBefore odd [2..9]  ==  [[2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8],[9]]

  > breakAfter odd [2..9]  ==  [[2,3],[4,5],[6,7],[8,9]]

  > breakDrop odd [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0]  ==  [[0,0,0],[0],[0,0]]

description: ! '\lio-simple\ adds LIO support for the \Simple\ \"framework-less\"

  web framework.  \Simple\ is minimalist, providing a lightweight base

  - the most basic \Simple\ app is little more than a WAI

  `Application` with some routing logic. Everything else (e.g.

  authentication, controllers, persistence, caching etc\'') is provided

  in composable units, so you can include only the ones you need in

  your app, and easily replace with your own components.

  LIO is an information flow control library that lets you enforce

  various security policies, including mandatory and discretionary

  access control.


  To get started, create an app skeleton with the `lio-simple` utility:


  @

  $ cabal install lio-simple

  $ lio-simple my_app_name

  $ cd my_app_name

  $ cabal run

  @'

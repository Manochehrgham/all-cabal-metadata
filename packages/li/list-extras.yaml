description: ! 'Common not-so-common functions for lists.


  Since "Data.List.Extras" is prime realestate for

  extensions to "Data.List", if you have something

  you''d like to contribute feel free to contact the

  maintainer (I''m friendly). I''m amenable to adopting

  code if you think your functions aren''t enough for

  a package on their own. Or if you would rather

  maintain a separate package I can share the

  @Data.List.Extras.Foo@ namespace.'

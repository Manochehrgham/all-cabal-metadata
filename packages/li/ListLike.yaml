description: ! 'Generic support for list-like structures in Haskell.


  The ListLike module provides a common interface to the various Haskell

  types that are list-like.  Predefined interfaces include standard

  Haskell lists, Arrays, ByteStrings, and lazy ByteStrings.  Custom

  types can easily be made ListLike instances as well.


  ListLike also provides for String-like types, such as String and

  ByteString, for types that support input and output, and for types that can handle

  infinite lists.'

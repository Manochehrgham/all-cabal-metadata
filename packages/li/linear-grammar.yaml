description: ! 'This library provides some simple tools for building abstract syntax
  trees,

  representing linear equations and (inclusive) inequalities. As an example:


  > 12x + 3y - 4z + 12 <= 43x - 7b + 8q


  Would look like...


  > f = (12 :: Double) .*. EVar "x" .+.

  >     (3 :: Double) .*. EVar "y" .+.

  >     (-4 :: Double) .*. EVar "z" .+.

  >     ELit 12

  >     .<=.

  >     (43 :: Double) .*. EVar "x" .+.

  >     (-7 :: Double) .*. EVar "b" .+.

  >     (8 :: Double) .*. EVar "q"


  I''ve added some overloading functionality, to help ease the verbosity of the

  above statements - an @IsString@ instance, and some other utilities. To pack

  the equation into <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation#General_.28or_standard.29_form
  standard form>,

  use the @sandardForm@ function:


  > stdF = standardForm f'

description: ! 'This project contains a library that utilizes the GHC API

  to provide some special features for Haskell text editors.

  Libhbb has been designed to extend ghc-mod (which does

  similar tasks) with certain features. However libhbb is

  completely independent of ghc-mod. The connection to

  ghc-mod is established in a package called hbb. The

  features of libhbb can be used standalone by the means of

  the executable libhbb-cli which is sipped as well.

  The big outstanding feature that libhbb provides is the

  ability to inline functions (their body is converted to a

  lambda function and written in place of the according

  name).'

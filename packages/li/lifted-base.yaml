description: ! '@lifted-base@ exports IO operations from the base library lifted to

  any instance of ''MonadBase'' or ''MonadBaseControl''.


  Note that not all modules from @base@ are converted yet. If

  you need a lifted version of a function from @base@, just

  ask me to add it or send me a patch.


  The package includes a copy of the @monad-peel@ testsuite written

  by Anders Kaseorg The tests can be performed using @cabal test@.'

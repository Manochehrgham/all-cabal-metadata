description: ! 'Note There are some known bugs in this code, do not use it in production!

  this package is meant mostly for easy cblas vs haskell benchmarks, not real use.



  The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide

  standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations.

  The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the

  Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform

  matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and

  widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality

  linear algebra software, LAPACK for example.

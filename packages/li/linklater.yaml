description: ! "## Who let you in here?\n\nRelax! I'm here to make your life easier.
  Has your company ever\nswitched to using [Slack](https://slack.com), and then you
  wanted to\nwrite silly Slack bots in Haskell as a way to learn Haskell?\n\n<sup>Really?<sup>Wow<sup>That
  was a pretty specific question.</sup></sup>\n\nUh, do you want to be friends? Well
  let's talk about it later, because right now I have an example for you.\n\nBut you'll
  have to grab me first:\n\n* `cabal sandbox init`\n* `cabal install linklater`\n\nIf
  you don't have Haskell, it's quite easy: [Windows](http://www.haskell.org/platform/),
  [Mac](http://ghcformacosx.github.io/), and [Linux](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/hlian/b5a975252997cb3e0020/raw/e4ecab3042225d321a88ee74e804c38ead38ed52/gistfile1.txt).\n\n##
  Show me an example!\n\n* [jpgtobot](https://github.com/hlian/jpgtobot/blob/master/Main.hs)
  is a slackbot that pastes the image at `foo.jpg.to` into chat. It even supports
  jpgto's flags: so `-- r+gif` will give you a GIF, randomly selected from all known
  images named `foo`. Thanks to the magic of -screen scraping-.\n  \n  ![jpgtobot
  in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlian/linklater/38536bebf00c60fb1214b2c3a741ce00485e87af/corgi.jpg)\n\n*
  [hi5bot](https://github.com/hlian/hi5bot/blob/master/Main.hs) lets you high-five
  people. There are other amazing things it can do too.\n\n## Features\n\n  * Uses
  `Text` for state-of-the-art Unicode support;\n  * Lovely documentation with no misspelllllings
  to be found;\n  * Supports [Slack's formatting syntax](https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting
  Slack's formatting syntax)\n  * Comes with a fast mode (`slashSimple`) and a power
  mode (`slash`)\n  * A warm, receptive maintainer with beautiful brown eyes;\n  *
  Fully Haddock'd methods and module;\n  * Open source (BSD3).\n\n## Contributors\n\n*
  [Hao Lian](https://hao.codes), author;\n* [Ulysses Popple](http://upopple.com/);
  and\n* [Ian Henry](https://ianthehenry.com/), who showed me the `flip (+) foo` ->
  `(+ foo)` trick;\n* *Shields* (the Grizzly Bear album), which I listened all the
  way through for the first time while I was writing this ★★★★.\n\n## See also\n\n*
  [tightrope](https://github.com/ianthehenry/tightrope), a library Ian should really
  document\n"

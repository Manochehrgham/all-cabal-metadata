description: ! 'The LinearSplit module implements partitioning the sequence of items
  to the

  subsequences in the order given. The items can be splitted using greedy

  heuristic or using the linear partition algorithm to minimize the maximum cost

  over all ranges (see the ''The Algorithm Design Manual'' by Steven S. Skiena..).


  The library can be used to balance the work across processors to minimize the run
  time.

  For the library usage take a look in examples/Splitter.hs.'

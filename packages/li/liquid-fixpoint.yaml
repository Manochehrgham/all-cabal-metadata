description: ! 'This package is a Haskell wrapper to the SMTLIB-based

  Horn-Clause/Logical Implication constraint solver used

  for Liquid Types.


  The solver itself is written in Ocaml.


  The package includes:


  1. Types for Expressions, Predicates, Constraints, Solutions


  2. Code for serializing the above


  3. Code for parsing the results from the fixpoint.native binary


  4. The Ocaml fixpoint code and pre-compiled binaries


  5. (Deprecated) Z3 binaries if you want to link against the API.


  Requirements


  In addition to the .cabal dependencies you require


  - A Z3 (<http://z3.codeplex.com>) or CVC4 (<http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu>) binary.

  If on Windows, please make sure to place the binary and any associated DLLs

  in your "cabal/bin" folder, right next to the fixpoint.native.exe binary.


  - An ocaml compiler (if installing with -fbuild-external).'

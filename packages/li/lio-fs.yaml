description: ! 'A very simple file system interface for LIO. Labels are associated

  with files and directories in the form of extended attributes.  This

  library exposes a simple API for on files and directories that

  abides by information flow control: a label on the file protects its

  contents, while a directory label protects the containing files''

  attributes (names and labels).


  See "LIO.FS.TCB" for a description of the filestore implementation

  and "LIO.FS.Simple" for a description of the actual API.


  This library is still under development, use with care.'

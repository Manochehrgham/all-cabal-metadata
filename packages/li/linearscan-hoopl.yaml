description: ! 'This module provides a convenience wrapper and a type class, ''NodeAlloc'',

  which makes it much easier to use the @linearscan@ library to allocate

  registers for Hoople intermediate representations.


  Additionally, it provides a DSL for construction of assembly language DSLs

  that compile into Hoople program graphs.  See the tests for a concrete

  example.'

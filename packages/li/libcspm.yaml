description: ! 'This library provides a parser, type checker and evaluator for machine
  CSP.

  The parser is designed to be compatible with FDR2 and, in particular, deals

  with the ambiguity between greater than and end of sequence in the same way

  (as far as possible, see "CSPM.Parser" for more information). The

  typechecker is as liberal as it is possible to make a typechecker without

  making typechecking undecidable. Documentation on the type system is

  forthcoming. The evaluator is relatively experimental, but should be able

  to evaluate any CSPM expression that FDR2 can. The output of this phase

  (if a process is evaluated) is a tree of CSP (note not CSPM) operator

  applications which should be suitable for input into a refinement checker,

  or other process algebraic tool.


  The main module of interest will be the "CSPM" module. This packages up

  most of the functionality of the library in an easy to use, relatively

  high level format. See "CSPM" for an example of how to use this module.'

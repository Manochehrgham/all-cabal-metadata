description: ! "# Vulkan\n\nHaskell bindings to the Vulkan graphics API\n\n## Building\n\nThis
  package requires GHC 8.0 or higher due to the use of the\n`DuplicateRecordFields`
  and `Strict` language extensions.\n\nI highly recommend compiling with `-O0` at
  the moment as compiling with\noptimizations leads to huge compile times. \n\n\n##
  Current Status\n\nAll the core Vulkan functionality is here.\n\nThis is currently
  a 64 bit only library, 32 bit support is on the roadmap.\n\nExamples can be found
  [here](https://github.com/expipiplus1/vulkan-examples)\n\n"

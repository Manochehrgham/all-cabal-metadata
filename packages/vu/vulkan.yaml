description: ! '# Vulkan


  Haskell bindings to the Vulkan graphics API


  ## Building


  This package requires GHC 8.0 or higher due to the use of the

  `DuplicateRecordFields` and `Strict` language extensions.


  I highly recommend compiling with `-O0` at the moment as compiling with

  optimizations leads to huge compile times. It''s likely that the library will be

  split into a few smaller modules in the future to alleviate this.


  ## Current Status


  All the core Vulkan functionality is here.


  This is currently a 64 bit only library, 32 bit support is on the roadmap.


  Examples are on the way!

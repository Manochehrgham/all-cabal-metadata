synopsis: Convert the WURFL file into a Parsec parser
changelog: ''

description-type: haddock
description: ! 'The WURLF file format (http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/) is not well
  adapted to the parsing of the user agent strings. It is useful to manage a database
  of mobile features.

  The Convert module in this package (see test.hs) will convert the WURLF tree into
  another tree that can be used to generate a Parsec parser.

  The Parsec parser can then be used with WURFLParser to quickly parse an user agent
  string. The infos extracted from WURLF are defined in WURFLType (MD data type).
  Nothing

  is preventing the lib from taking into account much more information from the WURLF
  file.

  The conversion of wurlf.xml and compilation of the lib are very slow since the generated
  tree in WurflVar.h is a huge Haskell tree. But, once it is compiled, its use in
  another project should be

  easy. This module is very experimental.'

  Kernel code for higher-level drawing built on Wumpus-Core. This

  package provides font loader code (currently limited to AFM font

  files) and a various /drawing objects/ intended to be a

  higher-level basis to make vector drawings than the primitives

  (paths, text labels) provided by Wumpus-Core.


  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is alpha grade and it is

  strongly coupled to the package @Wumpus-Drawing@ which is

  sub-alpha grade. The packages are split as it is expected they

  will have different development speeds - @Wumpus-Basic@ needs

  polishing and refinement; @Wumpus-Drawing@ simply needs a lot of

  work to move its components from /proof-of-concept/ ideas to

  being readily usable.



  NOTE - the demos that were previously included are now in the

  package @Wumpus-Drawing@.



  Changelog:


  v0.23.0 to v0.24.0:


  * Changes to type funs to work with GHC 7.4.


  * Removed FormatCombinators module.


  v0.22.0 to v0.23.0:


  * Re-worked the Chain module and API.


  * Replaced @ZDeco@ enumeration with @ZOrder@.


  * Removed the @Basic.Geometry@ modules, they are superseded in

  Wumpus-Drawing. Some of the equivalent functionality is now

  internal to the respective modules in Wumpus-Drawing - Wumpus

  has scaled back the amount of /geometric/ types and operations

  it wants to expose.


  * Renamed the @PlacedTrail@ object to @AnaTrail@ - the prefix

  vector is considered an /anacrusis/. Tidied up the API of the

  @Trail@ module.


  * Moved @bezierArcPoints@ and @BezierMinorArc@ from

  @Basic.Geometry@ and marked the @Basic.Geometry@ code as

  obsolute.


  v0.21.0 to v0.22.0:


  * Reverted argument order of @run@ functions they back to the

  @monadLib@ style (args * monadic_operation) rather than @MTL@

  style (monadic_operation * args). Typographically this seems

  better.


  * Removed module @Geometry.Paths@ it is superseded in

  Wumpus-Drawing.


  * Added user state to PosObject and moved it into

  @Kernel.Drawing@.


  * Changed the enumeration @DrawStyle@ to @DrawMode@. Added

  another enumeration @PathMode@.


  * Changed Chain so that first item in the chain is the start

  point (previously the start point was iterated by the chain).


  * Removed @ConnectorProps@ from the @DrawingContext@ , they are

  now used \"locally\" in Wumpus-Drawing.


  * Added more vector constructors to

  @Kernel.Objects.Displacement@.


  * Added extra methods to the @Decorate@ class for annotating

  SVG elements.


  v0.20.0 to v0.21.0:


  * The code from the @Kernel.Base.UserState@ module has been

  moved to the module @Kernel.Drawing.Basis@.


  * Moved @Image@ and @Query@ from @Objects.Basis@ to new module

  @Objects.Image@. Moved @Chain@, @CtxPicture@ and

  @TraceDrawing@ into the new @Drawing@ folder.


  * Added @Wumpus.Basic.Kernel.Drawing.LocDrawing@ module.


  * Rationalized the combinators exported by the drawing objects

  @Image@, @LocImage@, @LocThetaImage@ and @Connector@.

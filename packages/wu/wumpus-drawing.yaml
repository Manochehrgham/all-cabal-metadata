  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is sub-alpha. Although many of

  the drawing objects have been improved since the code was split

  from Wumpus-Basic, the code is still prototypical. Essentially

  this package is a /technology preview/ and not yet a re-usable

  library.


  NOTE - many of the demos use font metrics. Font metrics for

  the \"Core 14\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@

  files with GhostScript in the @fonts@ directory. Wumpus expects

  the GhostScript font metrics to be AFM version 2.0 files (this

  matches GhostScript 8.63). Alternatively, metrics for the Core

  14 fonts are available from Adode (AFM version 4.1), see the

  links below. To run the demos properly you will need one of

  these sets of metrics.


  Adobe Font technical notes:

  Core 14 AFM metrics:

  Also note that Wumpus uses fallback metrics (derived from the

  monospaced Courier font) when font loading fails, rather than

  throwing a terminal error. Applications should ideally check

  the font loading log to ensure that fonts have loaded correctly

  (the demos print this log to standard out).


  Changelog:


  v0.8.0 to v0.9.0:


  * Updated to work with wumpus-basic-0.24.0.


  * Removed monoid mappend alias @(<>)@ as it is now defined by

  Data.Monoid.


  v0.7.0 to v0.8.0:


  * Changed API to make Connectors.


  * Added InclineTrails to Drawing.Basis.


  * Reworked @Extras.Loop@.


  v0.6.0 to v0.7.0:


  * Changed paths - @RelPath@ has been removed and there are now

  only absolute paths. @PathBuilder@ builds absolute paths.

  Pen updating in @PathBuilder@ now works like a State monad

  rather than @local@ in a Reader monad.


  * Changed argument order of the run functions to @monadLib@

  style (params * monadic action) rather than @MTL@ style

  (monadic action * params).


  * Added Symbols to Drawing.Basis.


  * Added a tube box connector.


  v0.5.0 to v0.6.0:


  * Removed @LocTrace@ and @RefTrace@ from @Wumpus.Drawing.Basis@,

  they are superseded by @LocDrawing@ in Wumpus-Basic.


  * Remaned path building operations in @RelPathBuilder@.

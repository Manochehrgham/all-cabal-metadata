  Tree drawing with /nice/ layout.


  Draw trees represented by Data.Tree, output SVG or EPS. The

  output should be quite good - no overlapping edges, identical

  subtrees should have the same shape, leaf nodes evenly spaced.


  Note - the demos now use font metrics. Font metrics for the

  \"Core 14\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@ files

  with GhostScript (AFM file version 2.0 for GhostScript 8.63) or

  available from Adode (AFM file version 4.1). To run the demos

  properly you will need one of these sets of metrics.

  \*\* WARNING \*\* - the API is unstable and will change.


  Changelog:


  v0.19.0 to v0.20.0:


  * Updates to work with wumpus-drawing-0.9.0 and

  wumpus-basic-0.24.0.


  v0.18.0 to v0.19.0:


  * Updated to work with Wumpus-Basic-0.22.0 and

  wumpus-drawing-0.7.0.


  v0.17.0 to v0.18.0:


  * Updated to work with Wumpus-Basic-0.22.0 and

  wumpus-drawing-0.7.0.


  v0.16.0 to v0.17.0:


  * Reworked internals to use the @LocDrawing@ monad from

  Wumpus-Basic.


  v0.15.0 to v0.16.0:


  * Re-worked so tree drawings form a @LocGraphic@ rather than a

  @TraceDrawing@, this makes more in line with other graphic

  objects in Wumpus like shapes.


  * Changed node type to be any @LocImage@ where the answer

  supports anchors.

description: ! 'Euterpea is a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for

  computer music research, education, and development, providing

  both note-level and signal-level abstractions.  It is a descendant

  of Haskore and HasSound, and is intended for both educational purposes

  as well as serious computer music applications.  Euterpea is a

  wide-spectrum DSL, suitable for high-level music representation,

  algorithmic composition, and analysis; mid-level concepts such as

  MIDI; and low-level audio processing, sound synthesis, and instrument

  design.  It also includes a "musical user interface," a set of

  computer-music specific GUI widgets such as keyboards, pushbuttons,

  sliders, and so on.  The performance of Euterpea is intended to be

  as good as any other computer music language, with the goal of being

  able to develop real-time applications, using both MIDI and a

  high-performance back-end for real-time audio.'

description: ! 'The package consists of two command-line utilities to manage the /Asus
  WL500g Premium/

  router without logging to its admin page.


  The main utility is @WL500gPControl@ is used to ask the status of the connection

  (@Connected@/@Disconnected@), connection parameters (@DNS servers@, @Local IP@,

  @Foreign IP@ etc, log), and perform connection, disconnection and reconnection.


  Other utility - @WL500gPStatus@ created only to ease integration into <xmobar>

  and return only @Connected@ or @Disconnected@ string, enclosed into format

  tags (when option @-c@ is given).


  The last argument of these two utilities is a credentials file. It has simple format:


  @

  user: \<user name\>

  password: \<password\>

  host: \<host name or IP address\>

  @


  The password should be in plain text, so it is recommended to protect this

  file from reading for everyone except you.


  If credentials file is not given, than programs will try to use default

  credential file, which should be located:


  * on Linux: @$HOME\/.WL500gPControl\/credentials@


  * on Windows: @C\:\\Documents And Settings\\user\\Application Data\\WL500gPControl\\credentials@


  Sometimes paths could be different. To determine the read path to the

  default credentials file run @WL500gPControl -s@ and look at the error string, where

  will be sayed where it searches credentials file.'

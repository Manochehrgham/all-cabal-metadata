description: ! 'This package provides the standard Haskell list library

  reimplemented to allow stream fusion. This should in general

  provide faster list operations, and faster code for list-heavy

  programs.  See the paper /Stream Fusion: From Lists to Streams to Nothing at All/,

  Coutts, Leshchinskiy and Stewart, 2007.

  To use, simply import Data.List.Stream in place of Data.List,

  and hide list functions from the Prelude.'

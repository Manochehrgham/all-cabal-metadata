  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-types.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/stackage-types)


  This is a repository for sharing data types across multiple packages in the

  [Stackage project](https://www.stackage.org). In particular, it started as a

  means of sharing code between

  [stackage-curator](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-curator) and

  [stackage-server](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-server).


  For more information on the overall Stackage project, please see [the main

  stackage repo](https://github.com/fpco/stackage).

description: ! 'This library lets you create a one-shot timer, poll it using STM,

  and update it to ring at a different time than initially specified.


  It uses GHC event manager timeouts when available

  (GHC 7.2+, @-threaded@, non-Windows OS), yielding performance similar

  to @threadDelay@ and @registerDelay@.  Otherwise, it falls back to

  forked threads and @threadDelay@.


  [0.1.1]

  Add tryWaitDelayIO, improve performance for certain cases of @newDelay@

  and @updateDelay@, and improve example.'

description: ! 'The Stomp Protocol specifies message-oriented interoperability.

  Applications connect to a message broker to send (publish)

  or receive (subscribe) messages through queues.

  Interoperating applications do not know

  the location or internal structure of each other.

  They see only each other''s interfaces, /i.e./ the messages

  published and subscribed through a broker.


  The Stomp Queue library provides

  a Stomp client, using abstractions like ''Reader'' and ''Writer'' Queues.

  The Stomp Conduit library provides an abstraction level

  on top of queues, where not single messages are in the focus

  of the API, but streams of messages,

  either infinite streams or

  multipart messages with an explicit last message segment.

  The latter concept is

  an extension of the Stomp specification.


  More information, examples and a test suite are available

  on <http://github.com/toschoo/mom>.

  The Stomp specification can be found at

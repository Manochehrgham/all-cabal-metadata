description: ! 'This package implements functions, analogous

  to those from Data.List, to create and manipulate

  infinite lists: @data Stream a = Cons a (Stream a)@.

  It provides alternative definitions for those

  Prelude functions that make sense for such streams.

  Note that this package has (almost)

  nothing to do with the work on /Stream Fusion/ by

  Duncan Coutts, Roman Leshchinskiy, and Don Stewart.'

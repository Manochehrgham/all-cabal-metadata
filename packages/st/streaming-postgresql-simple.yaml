synopsis: Stream postgresql-query results using the streaming library
changelog: ! "# Revision history for streaming-postgresql-simple\n\n## 0.2.0.0  --
  2017-02-03\n\n### Correctly perform finalisation in `query` functions.\n\nThe previous
  implementation would perform the necessary finalisation only if the\nstream was
  drained. Some handling was in-place such that exceptions wouldn't\ncause the stream
  to end prematurely, but this isn't enough. We now use \n`MonadResource` to register
  an action to drain the stream.\n\nUsers should now wrap calls using `query` with
  `runResourceT`:\n\n```haskell\n>>> runResourceT (S.mapM_ print (query c \"SELECT
  * FROM t\"))\n```\n\n### Correctly deal with transactions in `stream`\n\n`stream`
  requires a transaction in order to function. If there isn't a \ntransaction open,
  `stream` would create one, but if you manually called `commit`\nor `rollback` from
  within the stream, the internal state would become \ninconsistent. This would lead
  to confusing error messages.\n\nWe now watch the transaction state as we pull items
  out from the stream, and\ninform the user if the internal state is not what we expected.
  Further more,\ncleanup actions (commit/rolling back the transaction) now only happen
  if there\nis still a transaction open. \n\n\n## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-02-02\n\n* First
  version. Released on an unsuspecting world. Mwahaha.\n"

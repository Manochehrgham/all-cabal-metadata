description: ! 'The Stomp Protocol specifies message-oriented interoperability.

  Applications connect to a message broker to send (publish)

  or receive (subscribe) messages through queues.

  Interoperating applications do not know

  the location or internal structure of each other.

  They see only each other''s interfaces, /i.e./ the messages

  published and subscribed through the broker.

  Broker and application use a protocol based on the

  exchange of commands and other data packets, called /frames/.

  The Stompl library provides abstractions over Stomp frames

  and a Stomp frame parser.

  It does not implement a client or broker itself,

  but provides abstractions to libraries and programs doing so.

  It is used by the Stompl Queue library (stomp-queues).

  More documentation and a test suite can be found on

  <https://github.com/toschoo/mom/>.

  The Stomp specification can be found at

  <http://stomp.github.com>.


  Release History:


  [0.2.0] The mime package (Codec.MIME) switch from String

  to Text in 0.4. We follow. Thanks, Dave!


  [0.1.1] Dependency for bytestring set to 0.10


  [0.1.0] Major changes:


  - Compliance with Stomp 1.2:


  - header keys and values are now escaped;

  this, in fact, was missing for Stomp 1.1.


  - header keys and values are not trimmed or padded;

  this, as well, should have been done for Stomp 1.1 already.

  Be aware that Stomp 1.0-like message headers

  may fail now, /e.g./:

  /message : hello world/

  is not the same anymore as

  /message:hello world/


  - carriage return (ascii 13) plus line feed (ascii 10)

  is now accepted as end-of-line;

  note that stompl never generates carriage return as end-of-line,

  the standard end-of-line remains line feed.


  - the Message frame may have an /ack/ header

  and should have when a message is sent

  through a queue that requires explicit ack.


  - the mandatory header in the Ack frame is now /id/

  instead of /message-id/. It should correspond to /ack/

  in the message that is ack''d.

  Note that, to ease backward compatibility,

  Ack frames are generated with both:

  an /id/ and a /message-id/ header.


  - a Stomp frame was added.

  The Stomp frame has exactly the same format

  as the Connect frame, but it is handled differently

  with respect to escaping: Connect header keys and values

  are not escaped, Stomp header keys and values, however, are.


  [0.0.3] Major changes:


  - new attribute "ClientId" in Connect frame

  for compatibility with ActiveMQ;


  - all commands accept additional headers

  to ease adaptations to broker-specific features.


  [0.0.2] Minor corrections and documentation


  [0.0.1] Initial Release'

description: ! 'This package provides various functions for working with strings,

  such as @join@, @split@, @toUppercase@, etc.


  The functions in this package work with all kinds of strings

  such as Text, ByteString, String, and their respective lazy counter

  parts. There is also an interface which is agnostic of the underlying

  string type.


  [@v1.0.2@] Fixed an issue with @strSplitAll@. Applied to the empty string

  it should return an empty list, but it returned a list containing

  a single empty string. It now returns correctly the empty list.


  [@v1.1@] Added @strToUpper@, @strToLower@, @strCapitalize@, @strCons@,

  and  @strMap@. Also @sCapitalize@, @sCons@, and @sMap@.'

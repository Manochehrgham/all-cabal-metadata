description: ! 'This library is based on an STM-specialized implementation of a

  Hash Array Mapped Trie.

  It provides efficient implementations of @Map@, @Set@

  and other data structures,

  which are slightly slower than their counterparts from \"unordered-containers\",

  but scale very well on concurrent access patterns.


  For details on performance of the library see

  <http://nikita-volkov.github.io/stm-containers/ this blog post>.'

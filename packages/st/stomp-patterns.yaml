description: ! 'The Stomp Protocol specifies a reduced message broker

  with queues usually read by one application and written

  by one or more applications.

  The specification does not include other, more advanced,

  interoperability patterns, where, for example,

  a client requests a job from a server or

  a publisher sends data to many subscribers.

  Such communication patterns, apparantly,

  are left to be implemented by applications.

  Patterns like client-server, publish and subscribe

  and many others, however, are used over and over again

  in message-oriented applications.


  This library implements a number of communication patterns

  on top of the Stomp specification

  that are often used and often described in the literature.

  There is a set of /basic/ patterns,


  * client-server,


  * publish and subscribe and


  * pusher-worker (pipeline)


  as well as a set of derived patterns, namely:


  * Desk: A service to obtain the access point

  (/i.e./ queue name) of a specified provider;


  * Load balancers: Services to balance requests

  among a group of connected /workers/

  (a.k.a. /Majordomo/ pattern);


  * Bridge: Connections between brokers.


  More information, examples and a test suite are available

  on <http://github.com/toschoo/mom>.

  The Stomp specification can be found at

  <http://stomp.github.com>.


  The notion of /pattern/ and the related concepts,

  as they are presented here,

  rely heavily on

  Pieter Hintjens, \"Code Connected\", O''Reilly, 2013

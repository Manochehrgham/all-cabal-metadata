description: ! 'Provides functions to perform a linear regression between 2 samples,
  see the documentation of the linearRegression functions. This library is based on
  the ''statistics'' package.


  * 0.3: you can now use all functions on any instance of the Vector class (not just
  unboxed vectors).


  * 0.2.4: added distribution estimations for standard regression parameters.


  * 0.2.3: added robust-fit support.


  * 0.2.2: added the Total-Least-Squares version and made some refactoring to eliminate
  code duplication


  * 0.2.1: added the r-squared version and improved the performances.


  Code sample:


  > import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed as U

  >

  > test :: Int -> IO ()

  > test k = do

  >   let n = 10000000

  >   let a = k*n + 1

  >   let b = (k+1)*n

  >   let xs = U.fromList [a..b]

  >   let ys = U.map (\x -> x*100 + 2000) xs

  >   -- thus 100 and 2000 are the alpha and beta we want

  >   putStrLn "linearRegression:"

  >   print $ linearRegression xs ys


  The r-squared and Total-Least-Squares versions work the same way.'

description: ! '`Stream` can be used wherever `FreeT` is used. The compiler''s

  standard range of optimizations work better for operations

  written in terms of `Stream`. See the examples in @Streaming.Prelude@

  for a sense of how simple the library is to use and think about.


  @Streaming.Prelude@ closely follows

  @Pipes.Prelude@, but cleverly /omits the pipes/. It is focused

  on employment with base functors which generate

  effectful sequences. These appear elsewhere under titles like


  > pipes:      Producer a m r, Producer a m (Producer a m r), FreeT (Producer a m)
  m r

  > io-streams: InputStream a, Generator a r

  > conduit:    Source m a, ConduitM () o m r


  and the like.


  Interoperation with

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes pipes>

  is accomplished with this isomorphism:


  > Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next        :: Stream (Of a) m r   -> Producer a m r

  > Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next        :: Producer a m r      -> Stream (Of a) m
  r


  Interoperation with

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-streams>

  is thus:


  > Streaming.reread IOStreams.read     :: InputStream a       -> Stream (Of a) IO
  ()

  > IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons  :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream
  a)


  A simple exit to <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> would be,
  e.g.:


  > Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons    :: Stream (Of a) m ()  -> Source m a


  These conversions should never be more expensive than a single @>->@ or @=$=@.

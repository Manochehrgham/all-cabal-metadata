description: ! 'This module provides functions that can replace calls to

  ''atomically'' and count how often the transaction was retried

  until it succeeded. It can emit warnings when transaction are

  retried more often than a given threshold, and provides global

  statistics across all transaction.


  As an additional feature, if the transaction was named,

  transaction-related exceptions such as

  ''BlockedIndefinitelyOnSTM'' are replaced by variants that

  indicate which transaction caused the exception.

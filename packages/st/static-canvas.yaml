description: ! 'A simple DSL for writing HTML5 Canvas in haskell and converting it

  to Javascript. By static we mean non-interactive, so the parts of

  the Canvas API that need to query the browser for run time information

  like `isPointInPath(x, y)` are not included. This turns out to be

  a surprisingly small part of HTML5 Canvas.'

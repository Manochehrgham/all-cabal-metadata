synopsis: Concurrency support for the streaming ecosystem
changelog: ! "# Revision history for streaming-concurrency\n\n## 0.2.0.0  -- 2017-07-05\n\n*
  Rename functions to match the `with...` naming scheme:\n\n    - `merge{Streams,ByteStrings}`
  to `withMerged{Streams,ByteStrings}`\n    - `read{Stream,ByteString}Basket` to `with{Stream,ByteString}Basket`\n\n*
  Add the ability to use buffers to concurrently transform the stream;\n  following
  functions added:\n\n    - `withBufferedTransform`\n    - `withStreamMap`\n    -
  `withStreamMapM`\n    - `withStreamTransform`\n\n    (Note: it is not sound in the
  general case to transform a\n    streaming `ByteString`; as such, functions for
  this are not\n    implemented though it is possible to do yourself.)\n\n## 0.1.0.0
  \ -- 2017-07-04\n\n* First version.\n"

  > Concurrency for the [streaming] ecosystem


  The primary purpose for this library is to be able to merge multiple

  `Stream`s together.  However, it is possible to build higher

  abstractions on top of this to be able to also feed multiple streams.

  Thanks and recognition

  ----------------------


  The code here is heavily based upon -- and borrows the underlying

  `Buffer` code from -- Gabriel Gonzalez''s [pipes-concurrency].  It

  differs from it primarily in being more bracket-oriented rather than

  providing a `spawn` primitive, thus not requiring explicit garbage

  collection.

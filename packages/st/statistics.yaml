changelog: ! "Changes in 0.13.0.0\n\n  * All types now support JSON encoding and decoding.\n\nChanges
  in 0.12.0.0\n\n  * The `Statistics.Math` module has been removed, after being\n
  \   deprecated for several years.  Use the\n    [math-functions](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/math-functions)\n
  \   package instead.\n\n  * The `Statistics.Test.NonParametric` module has been
  removed, after\n    being deprecated for several years.\n\n  * Added support for
  Kendall's tau.\n\n  * Added support for OLS regression.\n\n  * Added basic 2D matrix
  support.\n\n  * Added the Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\nChanges in 0.11.0.3\n\n  * Fixed
  a subtle bug in calculation of the jackknifed unbiased variance.\n\n  * The test
  suite now requires QuickCheck 2.7.\n\n  * We now calculate quantiles for normal
  distribution in a more\n    numerically stable way (bug #64).\n\nChanges in 0.10.6.0\n\n
  \ * The Estimator type has become an algebraic data type.  This allows\n    the
  jackknife function to potentially use more efficient jackknife\n    implementations.\n\n
  \ * jackknifeMean, jackknifeStdDev, jackknifeVariance,\n    jackknifeVarianceUnb:
  new functions.  These have O(n) cost instead\n    of the O(n^2) cost of the standard
  jackknife.\n\n  * The mean function has been renamed to welfordMean; a new\n    implementation
  of mean has better numerical accuracy in almost all\n    cases.\n\nChanges in 0.10.5.2\n\n
  \ * histogram correctly chooses range when all elements in the sample are same\n
  \   (bug #57)\n\n\nChanges in 0.10.5.1\n\n  * Bug fix for S.Distributions.Normal.standard
  introduced in 0.10.5.0 (Bug #56)\n\n\nChanges in 0.10.5.0\n\n  * Enthropy type class
  for distributions is added.\n\n  * Probability and probability density of distribution
  is given in\n    log domain too.\n\nChanges in 0.10.4.0\n\n  * Support for versions
  of GHC older than 7.2 is discontinued.\n\n  * All datatypes now support 'Data.Binary'
  and 'GHC.Generics'.\n\nChanges in 0.10.3.0\n\n  * Bug fixes\n\nChanges in 0.10.2.0\n\n
  \ * Bugs in DCT and IDCT are fixed.\n\n  * Accesors for uniform distribution are
  added.\n\n  * ContGen instances for all continous distribtuions are added.\n\n  *
  Beta distribution is added.\n\n  * Constructor for improper gamma distribtuion is
  added.\n\n  * Binomial distribution allows zero trials.\n\n  * Poisson distribution
  now accept zero parameter.\n\n  * Integer overflow in caculation of Wilcoxon-T test
  is fixed.\n\n  * Bug in 'ContGen' instance for normal distribution is fixed.\n\nChanges
  in 0.10.1.0\n\n  * Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric test added.\n\n  * Pearson chi
  squared test added.\n\n  * Type class for generating random variates for given distribution\n
  \   is added.\n\n  * Modules 'Statistics.Math' and 'Statistics.Constants' are moved
  to\n    the @math-functions@ package. They are still available but marked\n    as
  deprecated.\n\n\nChanged in 0.10.0.1\n\n  * @dct@ and @idct@ now have type @Vector
  Double -> Vector Double@\n\n\nChanges in 0.10.0.0\n\n  * The type classes Mean and
  Variance are split in two. This is\n    required for distributions which do not
  have finite variance or\n    mean.\n\n  * The S.Sample.KernelDensity module has
  been renamed, and\n    completely rewritten to be much more robust.  The older module\n
  \   oversmoothed multi-modal data.  (The older module is still\n    available under
  the name S.Sample.KernelDensity.Simple).\n\n  * Histogram computation is added,
  in S.Sample.Histogram.\n\n  * Discrete Fourie transform is added, in S.Transform\n\n
  \ * Root finding is added, in S.Math.RootFinding.\n\n  * The complCumulative function
  is added to the Distribution\n    class in order to accurately assess probalities
  P(X>x) which are\n    used in one-tailed tests.\n\n  * A stdDev function is added
  to the Variance class for\n    distributions.\n\n  * The constructor S.Distribution.normalDistr
  now takes standard\n    deviation instead of variance as its parameter.\n\n  * A
  bug in S.Quantile.weightedAvg is fixed. It produced a wrong\n    answer if a sample
  contained only one element.\n\n  * Bugs in quantile estimations for chi-square and
  gamma distribution\n    are fixed.\n\n  * Integer overlow in mannWhitneyUCriticalValue
  is fixed. It\n    produced incorrect critical values for moderately large\n    samples.
  Something around 20 for 32-bit machines and 40 for 64-bit\n    ones.\n\n  * A bug
  in mannWhitneyUSignificant is fixed. If either sample was\n    larger than 20, it
  produced a completely incorrect answer.\n\n  * One- and two-tailed tests in S.Tests.NonParametric
  are selected\n    with sum types instead of Bool.\n\n  * Test results returned as
  enumeration instead of @Bool@.\n\n  * Performance improvements for Mann-Whitney
  U and Wilcoxon tests.\n\n  * Module @S.Tests.NonParamtric@ is split into @S.Tests.MannWhitneyU@\n
  \   and @S.Tests.WilcoxonT@\n\n  * sortBy is added to S.Function.\n\n  * Mean and
  variance for gamma distribution are fixed.\n\n  * Much faster cumulative probablity
  functions for Poisson and\n    hypergeometric distributions.\n\n  * Better density
  functions for gamma and Poisson distributions.\n\n  * Student-T, Fisher-Snedecor
  F-distributions and Cauchy-Lorentz\n    distrbution are added.\n\n  * The function
  S.Function.create is removed. Use generateM from\n    the vector package instead.\n\n
  \ * Function to perform approximate comparion of doubles is added to\n    S.Function.Comparison\n\n
  \ * Regularized incomplete beta function and its inverse are added to\n    S.Function\n"

description: ! '# Statistics: efficient, general purpose statistics


  This package provides the Statistics module, a Haskell library for

  working with statistical data in a space- and time-efficient way.


  Where possible, we give citations and computational complexity

  estimates for the algorithms used.



  # Performance


  This library has been carefully optimised for high performance.  To

  obtain the best runtime efficiency, it is imperative to compile

  libraries and applications that use this library using a high level of

  optimisation.



  # Get involved!


  Please report bugs via the

  [github issue tracker](https://github.com/bos/statistics/issues).


  Master [git mirror](https://github.com/bos/statistics):


  * `git clone git://github.com/bos/statistics.git`


  There''s also a [Mercurial mirror](https://bitbucket.org/bos/statistics):


  * `hg clone https://bitbucket.org/bos/statistics`

description: ! 'A revival of the classic racing game Stunts to serve as a

  non-toy-sized example for LambdaCube. In order to make it work, you

  need to download the original game as per the instructions given by

  the program.


  The program contains screenshotting functionality that allows you to

  capture frames as separate PNG files to produce movies with a smooth

  frame rate. To enable, install with the @capture@ flag:


  @cabal install --flags=capture@


  It is also possible to compile a version of the program that looks

  for the resource files in the current directory by enabling the

  @portable@ flag.'

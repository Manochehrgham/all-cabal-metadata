description: ! 'While tinkering on a project, I frequently found myself

  wanting to wait for an IO operation /unless/ something

  more important came up. The "Control.Concurrent.STM.OrElseIO"

  module is meant to reduce the boilerplate needed when choosing

  between IO actions and STM operations.


  You must use the threaded runtime with this package.


  TODO:


  * Kill off IO threads whose return values will never be needed.


  * Possibly rename @runOrElse@ and friends to @orElseIO@ or similar.'

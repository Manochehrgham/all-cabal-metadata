description: ! 'Functions for working with Dirichlet densities and mixtures

  on vectors.  The focus of this package is on deriving these

  distributions from observed data.


  This package should be treated as experimental code, it has

  not been battle-tested as much as it would be nice to be.


  Note that although this package is BSD3-licensed, it uses the

  @nonlinear-optimization@ package which is GPLed.  It should

  be straightforward to use another library in its stead,

  though.'

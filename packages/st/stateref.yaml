description: ! 'A collection of type-classes generalizing the

  read\/write\/modify operations for stateful variables

  provided by things like IORef, TVar, &c.

  Note that The interface has changed a bit from the

  0.2.* version.  \"*Ref\" functions are now called

  \"*Reference\" and new \"*Ref\" function exist with

  simpler signatures.

  The new ''Ref'' existential type provides a convenient

  monad-indexed reference type, and the HasRef class

  indicates monads for which there is a default

  reference type for every referent.'

description: ! 'A monad transformer version of the ST monad

  Warning! This monad transformer should not be used with monads that

  can contain multiple answers, like the list monad. The reason is that

  the state token will be duplicated across the different answers and this causes

  Bad Things to happen (such as loss of referential transparency). Safe

  monads include the monads State, Reader, Writer, Maybe and

  combinations of their corresponding monad transformers.'

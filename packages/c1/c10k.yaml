description: ! 'Network server library to handle

  over 10,000 connections. Since GHC 6.12 or

  earlier uses select(), it cannot handle

  connections over 1,024. This library uses

  the prefork technique to get over the barrier.

  Programs complied by GHC 6.10 or earlier

  with the -threaded option kill the IO thread

  when forkProcess is used. So, don''t specify

  the -threaded option to use this library.'

synopsis: Datatypes used by the Pushbullet APIs
changelog: ! "# Revision history for pushbullet-types\n\n## 0.3.0.0  -- 2017-07-29\n\n*
  `PushEphemeral` now supports the `targets` field, which allows to more\n  faithfully
  parse clipboard synchronization messages in the realtime event\n  stream.\n* Missing
  `Eq` and `Show` instances for `Ephemeral` are now derived.\n* Missing device-related
  datatypes and constructors are now exported.\n* Values commonly used by PushBullet
  for the DeviceIcon type now have a bunch\n  of constants exported for them.\n* Aeson
  version upper bound is now higher; this version of pushbullet-types\n  will now
  build with Stackage resolver lts-9.0.\n* Misc code cleanup.\n\n## 0.2.0.0  -- 2017-04-30\n\n*
  Some fields in `PushData` are now made optional, since the objects received\n  from
  Pushbullet may have them missing.\n* A minimum value for `PushbulletTime` is added.
  This is just zero seconds\n  since the POSIX epoch.\n* Ephemerals are reworked.
  Now `Ephemeral` actually has one constructor per\n  ephemeral type, and the previous
  constructors of `Ephemeral` are moved into\n  `PushEphemeral`. `Ephemeral` now has
  a constructor for tickles and nops.\n  Only push-type tickles have a dedicated constructor
  in `TickleType`.\n\n## 0.1.0.0  -- 2017-02-20\n\nDefine the following core types:\n\n*
  `Push` -- messages used internally in Pushbullet.\n* `Ephemeral` -- messages sent
  directly into the live event stream. These have\n  a multitude of uses, e.g. sending
  SMS via a phone or seeing whether\n  notifications have occurred on a device.\n*
  `Device` -- representation of a device.\n* `User` -- representation of a user.\n*
  `Permanant` -- this is an undocumented type in the Pushbullet API. Notably,\n  SMS
  threads and messages are permanents.\n\nSome of these types come in two flavors:
  `New` and `Existing`. This is\nsignalled by a type index coming from a datakind.\n"

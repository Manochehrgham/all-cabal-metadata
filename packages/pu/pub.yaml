  `pub` is an executable for piping data from stdin to a specified

  Redis pub/sub channel.


  A typical use for this tool is to tail a log file, match a specific

  line with grep, and pipe it into Redis where multiple consumers can

  do something different with each incoming log line:


  > tail -F /var/log/somelogfile.log | grep "tracker.gps.parsed" | pub loglines


  It also comes with a utility named `sub` for piping from a Redis

  pub/sub channel to stdout:


  > sub loglines | grep "somemsg"'

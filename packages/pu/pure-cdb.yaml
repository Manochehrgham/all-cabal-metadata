description: ! 'A library for reading and writing CDB (Constant Database) files.


  CDB files are immutable key-value stores, designed for extremely fast and memory-efficient

  construction and lookup. They can be as large as 4GB, and at no point in their construction

  or use must all data be loaded into memory. CDB files can contain multiple values
  for a

  given key.


  For more information on the CDB file format, please see: <http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html>


  Please note, that there is another pure Haskell CDB library on Hackage:

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-cdb>, using memory mapped bytestrings for
  IO.

  It served as an inspiration for this package.'

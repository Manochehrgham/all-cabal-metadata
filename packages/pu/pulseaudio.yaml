description: ! 'This package mainly exists, because I wanted to query the current
  system

  volume from the pulse audio server.


  Doing this required me to build at least the core of the pulse api.


  This package is provided as is, with very little testing and only a small

  subset of the pulse api implemented.

  Expanding this package *should* be rather easy. At least for query/control.

  If you are interested in doing this, but don''t know how, feel free to contact me.



  In package is a bit unrefined and rough. If you have better structure for

  modules feel free to reorganize them and making a PR. This also means, don''t

  see this structur as fixed yet, it may change if someone has a better idea.'

description: ! 'pcre-light utility functions for more user friendly usage.

  Instead of adding execution and compile options to the matching and

  compiling functions, the options are added to the regular expression to be

  compiled or run. Furthermore support for different matching return types

  (using typeclass ''MatchResult'') and different regular expression types

  (compiled or uncompiled using typeclass ''RegexLike'') are supported. See module

  documentation for examples.'

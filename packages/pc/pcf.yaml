description: ! 'PCF is a small programming language with higher order

  functions, natural numbers, and recursion. It is

  statically tpyed and turing complete (general

  recursion and all that). This compiler transformers

  a PCF expression into a file of C code that when run

  outputs the answer.

  It is mostly intended as a

  demonstration of how to write such a compiler. The

  curious reader should look at the <http://jozefg.bitbucket.org/posts/2015-03-24-pcf.html
  writeup>.'

description: ! 'PCG is a family of simple fast space-efficient statistically good

  algorithms for random number generation with better-than-typical

  cryptographic security. See http://http://www.pcg-random.org for more

  information.


  This library implements bindings to the standard C implementation.

  This includes the standard, unique, fast and single variants in the

  pcg family. There is a pure implementation that can be used as a

  generator with the random package as well as a faster primitive api

  that includes functions for generating common types.


  The generators in this module are suitable for use in parallel but

  make sure threads don''t share the same generator or things will go

  horribly wrong.'

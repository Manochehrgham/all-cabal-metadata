description: ! 'A small, efficient and portable regex library for Perl 5 compatible
  regular expressions


  The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular

  expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5.


  If installation fails reporting that you are missing the prce C library, try installing

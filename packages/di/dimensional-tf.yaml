description: ! 'Dimensional is a library providing data types for performing arithmetic

  with physical quantities and units. Information about the physical

  dimensions of the quantities and units is embedded in their types and the

  validity of operations is verified by the type checker at compile time.

  The boxing and unboxing of numerical values as quantities is done by

  multiplication and division with units. The library is designed to, as

  far as is practical, enforce/encourage best practices of unit usage.

  The dimensional-tf packade differs from the dimensional package in that

  the dimension tracking is implemented using type families rather than

  functional dependencies.'

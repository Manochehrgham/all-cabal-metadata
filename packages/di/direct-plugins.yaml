description: ! 'The Plugins package unfortunately does not work on GHC 6.12, and is
  at any rate

  rather poorly documented.  This package uses the same general strategy but without

  quite as many options, aiming to be simple and useful rather than complete.  This

  release renames load to unsafeLoad and adds loadDynamic, which is type-safe.'

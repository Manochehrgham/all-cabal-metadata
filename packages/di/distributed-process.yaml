description: ! 'This is an implementation of Cloud Haskell, as described in

  /Towards Haskell in the Cloud/ by Jeff Epstein, Andrew Black,

  and Simon Peyton Jones

  (<http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/parallel/>),

  although some of the details are different. The precise message

  passing semantics are based on /A unified semantics for future Erlang/

  by Hans Svensson, Lars-&#xc5;ke Fredlund and Clara Benac Earle.

  You will probably also want to install a Cloud Haskell backend such

  as distributed-process-simplelocalnet.'

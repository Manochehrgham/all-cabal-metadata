  #### A Haskell library for probability distributions


  This library provides a data structure and associated functions for

  representing discrete probability distributions.


  This library is optimized for very fast sampling. If ```n``` is the number of unique
  outcomes,

  sampling from the distribution is ```O(log(n))``` worst case, and ```O(1)``` best
  case.


  The average time complexity depends on the distribution. A more evenly distributed

  distribution will be closer to ```O(log(n))```. A less evenly dsitributed distribution

  will be closer to ```O(1)```.'

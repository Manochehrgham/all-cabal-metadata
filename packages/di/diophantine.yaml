description: ! 'A library for solving quadratic diophantine equations.


  This library is designed to solve for equations where:


  * The form is: ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0


  * a,b,c,d,e,f are integers.


  * Solutions are restricted to x and y are also integers.


  This library breaks down equations based on their type to solve them most

  efficiently. This library supports linear, simple hyperbolic, eliptical, and

  parabolic equations, with hyperbolics on the way.

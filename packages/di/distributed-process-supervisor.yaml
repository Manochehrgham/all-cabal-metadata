description: ! 'A part of the Cloud Haskell framework

  This package implements a process which supervises a set of other processes, referred
  to as its children.

  These child processes can be either workers (i.e., processes that do something useful
  in your application)

  or other supervisors. In this way, supervisors may be used to build a hierarchical
  process structure

  called a supervision tree, which provides a convenient structure for building fault
  tolerant software.

  For detailed information see "Control.Distributed.Process.Supervisor"'

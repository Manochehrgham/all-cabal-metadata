description: ! 'Use this library to read large directories as streams:


  * Use @ListT@ to assemble recursive directory traversals while still streaming


  * Use @pipes@ to read out the stream of results


  * Traversals only open directory streams lazily in response to demand


  * Avoid directories with insufficient permissions


  This library works on both Unix, OS X, and Windows.'

description: ! 'This project is a simple wiki developed based on a

  firm theoretical foundation.


  Documents are not stored directly, but as a composition

  tree of patches to an initial empty document. As our

  patches support operational transform, edits can be

  made to any version of each document and they are

  transformed to be applied to the latest version.


  This also makes it easy to use the group structure of

  patches to be able to revert changes (or the composition

  of several changes) from deep in a document''s history and

  preserve every other change.


  Right now the wiki doesn''t support many bells and whistles,

  such as administrator control, configurability, or user accounts,

  but they''re coming.'

description: ! 'The Task Framework intends to provide tools for task management, work
  scheduling and distributed task coordination.

  These capabilities build on the Async Framework as well as other tools and libraries.

  The framework is currently a work in progress. The current release includes a simple
  bounded blocking queue

  implementation only, as an example of the kind of capability and API that we intend
  to produce.'

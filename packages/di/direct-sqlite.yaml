description: ! 'This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings
  out

  there, but it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding.  As compared to

  bindings-sqlite3, it is slightly higher-level, in that it supports

  marshalling of data values to and from the database.  In particular, it

  supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs represented as ByteStrings.'

description: Find the diversity of a collection of entities, mainly for use with fasta
  sequences. Produces a binary which works on fasta files to find the diversity of
  any order and rarefaction curves for a sliding window across all positions in the
  sequences. To analyze just a collection of entities, just use the whole sequences
  and list flag.

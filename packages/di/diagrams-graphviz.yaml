description: ! 'Use GraphViz and diagrams together, with each doing what it does best:

  GraphViz for laying out graphs, and diagrams for drawing them.


  Makes use of the excellent

  [graphviz package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphviz) for

  doing the actual communication with graphviz.  So this package is

  actually little more than some glue code that makes it a bit easier to

  interface `diagrams` and the `graphviz` package.

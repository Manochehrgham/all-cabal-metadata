  using

  a Zookeeper cluster for name registration, lookups and leader election.

  Uses the hzk bindings to the Zookeeper multi-threaded C library.


  Objectives and features:


  * Compatible with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/distributed-process-p2p distributed-process-p2p>
  API - can work as a drop-in

  replacement.


  * No dependencies beyond those already included by distributed-process, hzk and
  network-transport-tcp.


  * Automatic registration of local names to Zookeeper.


  * Global singleton processes with leader election and re-elections on leader exit.

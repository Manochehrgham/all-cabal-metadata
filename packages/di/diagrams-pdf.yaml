description: ! 'This package provides a modular backend for rendering

  diagrams created with the diagrams EDSL to PDF

  files.  It uses @HPDF@ making it suitable for use on

  any platform.


  It is a very preliminary version where only the

  diagrams Logo generation has been tested.


  The package provides the following modules:


  * "Diagrams.Backend.Pdf.CmdLine" - if you''re

  just getting started with diagrams, begin here.


  * "Diagrams.Backend.Pdf" - look at this next.

  The general API for the HPDF backend.


  Additional documentation can be found in the

  README file distributed with the source tarball'

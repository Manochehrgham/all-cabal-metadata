description: ! 'This module only exports instances for @''MonadBase'' @''IO'' and

  @''MonadBaseControl'' @''IO'' for the @''Process'' monad. This is for use

  in conjunction with a library requiring these instances, such as the

  @<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lifted-base lifted-base> package.


  A tutorial segment regarding use of this in distributed-process applications may

  be found <http://haskell-distributed.github.io/tutorials/3ch.html#monad-transformer-stacks
  here>.


  example usage:


  >import Control.Distributed.Process.MonadBaseControl()

  >import Control.Concurrent.MVar.Lifted (withMVar)

  >

  >processWithMVar :: MVar a -> (a -> Process b) -> Process b

  >processWithMvar = withMVar'

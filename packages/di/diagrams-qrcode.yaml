description: ! 'This library is able to draw diagrams of QR codes using the

  @diagrams@ library.  In order to create the QR code itself, you

  may use either the @haskell-qrencode@ library or @qrcode@

  library, both are supported.  In order to draw and save the

  diagram to a file, we suggest using either the @diagrams-svg@

  library (pure Haskell, fast, SVG output only) or the

  @diagrams-cairo@ library (requires Cairo, supports many

  different output targets, including SVG, PNG, PDF, PS and

  directly onto a GUI).


  For an example of how this library may be used, please see the

  examples on the source code.'

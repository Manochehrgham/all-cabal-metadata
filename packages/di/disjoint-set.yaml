description: ! 'This is a persistent data structure for disjoint sets.


  The algorithm is described in "Introduction to

  Algorithms" by Cormen, et al. The implementation here

  uses both union by rank and path compression. We

  incur an O(logn) overhead because of the use of

  persistent maps.


  Data.IntDisjointSet is as strict as possible.'

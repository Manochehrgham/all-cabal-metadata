description: ! 'This package includes a monadic disjoint int set datatype, which can
  also be "frozen" into a non-monadic queriable

  disjoint set (which however can not be modified).


  In the future, I will write a wrapper that allows disjoint sets for all datatypes.


  One common use case for disjoint sets is for creating equivalence classes.'

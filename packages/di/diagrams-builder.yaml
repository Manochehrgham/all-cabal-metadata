description: ! '@diagrams-builder@ provides backend-agnostic tools for

  dynamically turning code into rendered diagrams,

  using the @hint@ wrapper to the GHC API.  It

  supports conditional recompilation using hashing

  of diagrams source code, to avoid recompiling

  code that has not changed.  It is useful for

  creating tools which compile diagrams code

  embedded in other documents.  For example, it is

  used by the @BlogLiterately-diagrams@ package (a

  plugin for @BlogLiterately@) to compile diagrams

  embedded in Markdown-formatted blog posts.


  Executables specific to the cairo, SVG, postscript,

  and rasterific

  backends are included (more executables specific

  to other backends may be included in the future).

  All take an input file and an expression to

  render, and output an image file.  If you want

  these executables you must explicitly enable the

  @-fcairo@, @-fsvg@, @-fpostscript@, or @-frasterific@ flags.


  A LaTeX package, @diagrams-latex.sty@, is also

  provided in the @latex/@ directory of the source

  distribution, which renders diagrams code found

  within @diagram@ environments. Note that

  @diagrams-latex.sty@ is licensed under the GPL.'

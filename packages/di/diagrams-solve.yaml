description: ! "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diagrams/diagrams-solve.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/diagrams/diagrams-solve)\n\nMiscellaneous
  pure-Haskell solver routines used in\n[diagrams](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/),
  a Haskell embedded\ndomain-specific language for compositional, declarative drawing.\n\nThis
  is split out into a separate package with no dependencies on the\nrest of diagrams
  in case it is useful to others, but no particular\nguarantees are made as to the
  suitability or correctness of the code\n(though we are certainly open to bug reports).\n\nCurrently
  the package contains:\n\n  - functions to find real roots of quadratic, cubic, and
  quartic\n    polynomials, in `Diagrams.Solve.Polynomial`\n\n  - functions to solve
  tridiagonal and cyclic tridiagonal systems of\n    linear equations, in `Diagrams.Solve.Tridiagonal`\n"

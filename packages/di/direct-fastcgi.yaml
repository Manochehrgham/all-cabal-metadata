description: ! 'This package is a native implementation of the FastCGI protocol, allowing

  Haskell to work with any webserver that supports it.  It makes no attempt to

  imitate the interface of the cgi-3000 and fastcgi-3000 packages, because

  that API is tied too heavily to legacy interfaces, as with its handling of

  exceptions, logging, and time.  Its advantage over those packages is

  primarily in the area of clean exception management and better control

  structure which allows more versatility in processing requests which are

  not simple GETs.  In particular, POST of large files should be possible, as

  should server-push responses which return content a piece at a time.  Also,

  of course, as a native implementation, there is no dependency on a C

  library, which simplifies the install process.

  Version 1.0.3 adds support for the new version of the network package, which

  integrates what used to be a separate package, network-bytestring.  It also

  provides compatibility with (unreleased as of this writing) GHC 7.1.

  Version 1.0.2 fixes a bug; response headers are now sent if they have

  not already been when fCloseOutput is called explicitly.  It also removes

  spurious debug output that had been left in by mistake.'

description: ! 'PLY is a lightweight file format for representing 3D

  geometry. The library includes support for

  placing mesh data into a consistent coordinate

  frame using Stanford''s @.conf@ file format. See

  /The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository/

  <http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/>

  for more information.

  This package provides a library for loading PLY

  data, and an executable, @ply2bin@, for dumping

  all vertex data referenced by a @.conf@ file to a

  flat binary file comprising an array of single

  precision float triples. Usage: @ply2bin confFile

  outputFile@.'

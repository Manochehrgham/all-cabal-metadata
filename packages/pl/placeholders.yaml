description: ! 'While working on some Haskell code, it is often useful to

  work incrementally by inserting @undefined@ as a

  placeholder for missing code.


  This library provides placeholders that produce better

  messages when evaluated at run-time and also generate

  compile-time warnings so that they do not get forgotten

  so easily.

  For details, see <http://github.com/ahammar/placeholders>'

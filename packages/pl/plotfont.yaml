description: ! "# PlotFont\n\nCrude fonts suitable for plotting.\n\nThere are many
  good looking fonts which optimize for appearance. I wanted\nsome cruder fonts which
  had a simpler representation: a relatively small\nnumber of straight lines which
  could easily be plotted by a machine, or\nperhaps a person.\n\n# Licenses\n\nThe
  code written by me is licensed under the GPL, version 2 or later.\n\nThe data for
  the fonts come from Jim Studt's canvastext.js\nhttp://jim.studt.net/canvastext/
  which he placed in the public\ndomain. He cites the original source as the Hershey
  fonts:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts\n\nThe Hershey fonts appear
  to have this license:\n\n1. The following acknowledgements must be distributed with\n
  \  the font data:\n\n      - The Hershey Fonts were originally created by Dr.\n
  \       A. V. Hershey while working at the U. S.\n        National Bureau of Standards.\n\n
  \    - The format of the Font data in this distribution\n        was originally
  created by\n          James Hurt\n          Cognition, Inc.\n          900 Technology
  Park Drive\n          Billerica, MA 01821\n          (mit-eddie!ci-dandelion!hurt)\n\n2.
  The font data in this distribution may be converted into\n   any other format *EXCEPT*
  the format distributed by\n   the U.S. NTIS (which organization holds the rights\n
  \  to the distribution and use of the font data in that\n   particular format).
  Not that anybody would really\n   *want* to use their format... each point is described\n
  \  in eight bytes as \"xxx yyy:\", where xxx and yyy are\n   the coordinate values
  as ASCII numbers.\n\nIt is not clear to me if Mr Studt used 'this distribution'.\n"

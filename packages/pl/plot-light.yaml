  `plot-light` provides functionality for rendering vector graphics as SVG.

  It is geared in particular towards scientific plotting, and it is termed "light"
  because it only requires a few common Haskell dependencies and no external libraries.

  It builds upon `blaze-svg` by adding type-safe combinators, geometry primitives
  and functionality.


  ## Usage


  To use this project you just need to import this module qualified (to avoid name
  clashes with any other modules you might have loaded on the side), for example as
  follows :


  `import Graphics.Rendering.Plot.Light as P`'

description: ! "# plot-light\n\nA lightweight plotting library, exporting to SVG\n\n[![Build
  Status](https://travis-ci.org/ocramz/plot-light.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ocramz/plot-light)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/plot-light.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/plot-light)\n[![plot-light](http://stackage.org/package/plot-light/badge/lts)](http://stackage.org/lts/package/plot-light)\n[![plot-light](http://stackage.org/package/plot-light/badge/nightly)](http://stackage.org/nightly/package/plot-light)\n\n\n\n\n`plot-light`
  provides functionality for rendering vector graphics as SVG.\nIt is geared in particular
  towards scientific plotting, and it is termed \"light\" because it only requires
  a few common Haskell dependencies and no external libraries.\nIt builds upon `blaze-svg`
  by adding type-safe combinators, geometry primitives and functionality.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo
  use this project you just need `import Graphics.Rendering.Plot.Light`. If GHC complains
  of name clashes you can import the module in \"qualified\" form.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nAvailable
  on Hackage : https://hackage.haskell.org/package/plot-light in the `Graphics.Rendering.Plot.Light`
  module\n\nPlease let me know if documentation is lacking or confusing. \n\n## Contributing\n\nYou
  can use `plot-light` in your own projects (either personal, academic or commercial),
  and all feedback such as comments, bug reports, feature requests and patches is
  welcome.\n\n\n## License\n\nBSD-3, see LICENSE file"

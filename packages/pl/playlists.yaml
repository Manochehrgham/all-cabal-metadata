description: ! 'Playlists is a library for working with media playlist files.  The

  original motivation for the library was extracting URLs for

  streaming radio stations that use PLS and M3U playlist files.


  The package also includes an executable that can dump the URLs from

  a playlist file and convert between playlist file formats.


  /Example:/


  > import qualified Data.ByteString as BS

  > import Text.Playlist

  >

  > readPlaylist :: Format -> IO Playlist

  > readPlaylist fmt = do

  >   content <- BS.getContents

  >   case parsePlaylist fmt content of

  >     Left err -> fail $ "failed to parse playlist on stdin: " ++ err

  >     Right x  -> return x


  /Playlist Executable Examples:/


  > $ playlist urls --format PLS < somefile.pls

  >

  > $ playlist convert --from PLS --to M3U < somefile.pls'

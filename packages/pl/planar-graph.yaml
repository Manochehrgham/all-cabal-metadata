description: ! 'Planar graphs are graphs that can be embedded onto a surface

  (i.e. they can be drawn on that surface without any edges crossing).

  As such, it is preferable to use a dedicated data structure for them

  that has information about how to achieve this embedding rather than a

  standard graph data structure.


  (Please note however that this implementation has only been tested in

  terms of the embedding being on the unit sphere or disc; whether it

  works or not as-is on any other type of surface is unknown.)'

description: ! "This is the `TreeViz` library, written by David Banas.\n\nFor more
  info, please, see the comments in `Data/Tree/LogTree.hs`.\nAlternatively, view the
  Haddock generated HTML documentation:\n  $ cabal haddock\n\nFor usage examples,
  please, see:\n- src/Main.hs\n\nThe intent of this library is to provide the data
  structures, type classes,\nand support functions necessary for working with and
  visualizing computation\ndecomposition trees. For instance, the initial motivation
  for creating this\npackage was the need to visualize how data flow occurs in a fast
  Fourier\ntransform (FFT) of arbitrary radices and either decimation style (time
  or\nfrequency).\n"

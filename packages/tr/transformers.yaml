description: ! 'A portable library of functor and monad transformers, inspired by

  the paper \"Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order

  Polymorphism\", by Mark P Jones,

  in /Advanced School of Functional Programming/, 1995

  (<http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html>).


  This package contains:


  * the monad transformer class (in "Control.Monad.Trans.Class")

  and IO monad class (in "Control.Monad.IO.Class")


  * concrete functor and monad transformers, each with associated

  operations and functions to lift operations associated with other

  transformers.


  The package can be used on its own in portable Haskell code, in

  which case operations need to be manually lifted through transformer

  stacks (see "Control.Monad.Trans.Class" for some examples).

  Alternatively, it can be used with the non-portable monad classes in

  the @mtl@ or @monads-tf@ packages, which automatically lift operations

  introduced by monad transformers through other transformers.'

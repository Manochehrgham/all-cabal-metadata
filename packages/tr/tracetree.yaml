description: ! 'The tracetree library can be used to conveniently write

  Haskell data structures as trees represented as JSON

  files. These JSON files can then be inspected with any

  JSON viewer; the JSON viewer''s functionality to collapse

  part of the JSON tree can be particularly convenient when

  exploring large objects.


  Additionally, the ttrender executable can be used to render

  these JSON trees as .svg or .png files, and provides

  various command line flags for controlling the layout of

  the tree (colour, orientation, hiding nodes, etc.).


  The tracetree library and ttrender executable are

  independent components; if you don''t want to add the

  dependency on tracetree to your project, you can just

  generate the .JSON files directly in your code; the format

  is not complicated (indeed, you can create them by hand

  or post-process previously exported .JSON files).'

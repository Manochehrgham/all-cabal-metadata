description: ! 'This library is a solution for http-based routing and dispatch. It''s

  goals are similar to the goals of `servant`. However, `trasa` relies

  on very different mechanisms to accomplish this. There are no typeclasses

  in this library, and there is a single closed type family that is provided

  as a convenience. All of the real work is accomplish with GADTs,

  universal quantification, and plain old haskell data types.'

description: ! 'Trajectory <http://apptrajectory.com/> is a project

  estimation and management tool for project managers,

  product managers, developers, and designers. It is heavily

  inspired by, but improves upon, Basecamp and Pivotal

  Tracker. Like Basecamp, it has a place to organize ideas

  and exchange free-form feedback; like Pivotal Tracker it

  has the concept of stories with points instead of time

  estimations, and it calculates time estimations based on

  past performance. It also weds the two concepts,

  connecting stories with ideas.


  This is a collection of tools and libraries for interacting with Trajectory.


  It provides the @lsstory@ tool, a command-line app that

  can list stories, filtering by source idea, milestone,

  point, assignment, whether design or development is

  needed; it can filter on the state (unstarted, started,

  finished, done); it can filter on the iteration. It can

  also be used simply to tell you the next unstarted,

  unassigned development story to work on.


  To build more with this package, look into the

  @Trajectory.API@ module.


  Trajectory is made by thoughtbot <http://thoughtbot.com/>.'

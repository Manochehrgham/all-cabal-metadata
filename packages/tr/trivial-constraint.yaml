description: ! 'Since GHC 7.4, constraints are first-class: we have the constraint
  kind, and thus type-classes have a kind such as @* -> Constraint@.


  These can be used as parameters to data types. They also can be combined quite nicely,


  @

  type NewConstraint a = (Constraint1 a, Constraint2 a)

  @


  however you always need to start with a plain old type class when building constraints.


  This library provides a type class that is not really a constraint at all, so you
  can "start from zero" with building up a custom constraint.

  Also its opposite (a constraint that no type can ever fulfill).'

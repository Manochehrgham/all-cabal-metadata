description: ! 'Provides a efficient and compact implementation of generalized tries,
  and Template Haskell tools to generate

  the necessary translation code.  This is meant as a drop-in replacement for Data.Map,
  and can be used anywhere

  @Data.Map@ can be used.


  The most recent release combines zipper-based ideas from recently proposed changes
  to Data.Map, as well

  as heavily optimized ByteString and Vector instances based on the vector package.

  For best performance, use @cabal install -fllvm -O2@.'

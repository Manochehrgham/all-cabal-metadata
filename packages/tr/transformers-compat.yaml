synopsis: A small compatibility shim exposing the new types from transformers 0.3
  and 0.4 to older Haskell platforms.
changelog: ! "0.4.0.4\n-------\n\n0.4.0.3\n-------\n\n0.4.0.2\n-------\n* Each of
  these is a build with a different set of flags configured. Building this way allows
  us to work around bugs in `cabal`'s backtracker.\n\n0.4\n---\n* Added support for
  the missing `ExceptT` instances from `mtl`.\n\n  This was not done lightly. While
  this means that by default incurring a dependency on `transformers-compat` drags
  in `mtl` when you are\n  using an old `transformers`, it means that users do not
  have to orphan these instances and permits wider adoption of `ExceptT`.\n\n  If
  you absolutely can't stand `mtl` and really want this package to build as valid
  `Haskell98`, then you can use `cabal install transformers-compat -f-mtl` to avoid
  incurring the dependency to get these instances. However, that is effectively an
  unsupported configuration.\n\n0.3.3.4\n-------\n\n0.3.3.3\n-------\n\n0.3.3.2\n-------\n*
  These releases were a successful attempt to fix build problems caused by the cabal
  backtracker.\n* Each of these is a build with a different set of flags configured.\n\n0.3.2\n-----\n*
  This release was a failed (or at least, only partially successful) attempt to fix
  build problems caused by the cabal backtracker.\n\n0.3.1\n-----\n* `transformers
  0.4.1` compatibility\n\n0.3\n---\n* Added the instances for `Data.Functor.Classes`
  from `transformers 0.4`\n* Switched `Control.Applicative.Backwards` and `Data.Functor.Reverse`
  to the split constructor/accessor style from `transformers 0.4`.\n\n0.2\n---\n*
  Added the new types and classes from `transformers 0.4`\n\n0.1.1.1\n-------\n* Wrote
  a better synopsis\n\n0.1.1\n-----\n* Updated to trick `cabal` into building an empty
  `libHStransformers-compat-0.1.a` on GHC 7.6.\n\n0.1\n---\n* Repository initialized
  by pulling the `transformers-0.2` compatibility layer out of `lens`.\n"

  ===================


  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/transformers-compat.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/transformers-compat)


  This provides a thin compatibility shim on top of transformers-0.2 to add the types
  that were added in transformers-0.3.


  This enables users to maintain haskell-platform compatibility, while still gaining
  access ot the new functionality.

description: ! 'This package includes backported versions of types that were added

  to transformers in transformers 0.3 and 0.4 for users who need strict

  transformers 0.2 or 0.3 compatibility to run on old versions of the

  platform, but also need those types.


  Those users should be able to just depend on @transformers >= 0.2@

  and @transformers-compat >= 0.3@.


  Note: missing methods are not supplied, but this at least permits the types to be
  used.'

description: ! 'This is a generic programming library in the spirit of

  \"Scrap your boilerplate with class\", but with several

  improvements â€” most notably, it''s based on the @gtraverse@

  function instead of @gfoldl@.

  @gtraverse@ is equivalent in power to @gfoldl@, but lets

  you more easily write non-standard views of the data type.'

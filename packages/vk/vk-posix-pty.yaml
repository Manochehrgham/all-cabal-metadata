description: ! 'This package simplifies the creation of subprocesses that interact
  with

  their parent via a pseudo terminal (see @man pty@).


  Included @ptywrap@ utility spawns a process with a @pty@, forwards its

  output to stdout as plain text without buffering and forwards the exit code.

  Note that it __does not__ handle standard input.


  > ptywrap: usage: ptywrap [command to run]'

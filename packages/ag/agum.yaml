description: ! 'The unification problem is given the problem

  statement t =? t\'', find a most general

  substitution s such that s(t) = s(t\'') modulo

  the axioms of an Abelian group.  The matching

  problem is to find a most general substitution

  s such that s(t) = t\'' modulo the axioms.

  Substitition s is more general than s\'' if

  there is a substitition s\" such that s\'' =

  s\" o s.'

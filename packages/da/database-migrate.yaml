description: ! 'A database versioning and migration library.


  /Note/: This library is under heavy development, currently

  the PostgreSQL implementation is functional, but

  expected to change. It is intended that a type safe

  migration api, command line tools and MySql support be added

  before this library will be considered stable.'

description: ! 'Easy to use set of utility functions, implementing a Data.Maybe like

  interface for other common types, like Either, List, Bool, Tuple,

  or even member of the Monoid type class.

  Also features a set of conversion functions among them,

  using sensible defaults.


  Most of these functions are one liners, and this library started out as a

  self-educational project, which nevertheless proved to to be useful on its

  own right.

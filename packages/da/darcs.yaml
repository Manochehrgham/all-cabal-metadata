description: ! 'Darcs is a free, open source revision control

  system. It is:


  * Distributed: Every user has access to the full

  command set, removing boundaries between server and

  client or committer and non-committers.


  * Interactive: Darcs is easy to learn and efficient to

  use because it asks you questions in response to

  simple commands, giving you choices in your work

  flow. You can choose to record one change in a file,

  while ignoring another. As you update from upstream,

  you can review each patch name, even the full "diff"

  for interesting patches.


  * Smart: Originally developed by physicist David

  Roundy, darcs is based on a unique algebra of

  patches.


  This smartness lets you respond to changing demands

  in ways that would otherwise not be possible. Learn

  more about spontaneous branches with darcs.'

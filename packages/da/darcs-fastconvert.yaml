description: ! 'The darcs-fastconvert tool allows you to both import

  git repositories into darcs (using git fast-export)

  and export darcs repositories into git (using git

  fast-import). You may also achieve some success with

  3rd-party fast-import/fast-export tools, like

  bzr-fastimport although this is not explicitly

  supported or tested. Often, converting from X to git

  and then to darcs works better than direct X to darcs

  conversion using 3rd-party tools.'

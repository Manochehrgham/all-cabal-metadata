description: ! 'The library implements /directed acyclic word graphs/ (DAWGs) internally

  represented as /minimal acyclic deterministic finite-state automata/.

  The implemented version of DAWG is, semantically, a map from

  sequences of alphabet symbols (keys) to values.


  The library allows to build DAWGs over any symbols and values

  provided that they both have `Ord` instances (see the

  `Data.DAWG.Ord` module).

  It also provides a fast insert operation which can be used to

  construct DAWGs on-the-fly.'

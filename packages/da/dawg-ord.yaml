description: ! 'The library implements /directed acyclic word graphs/ (DAWGs)

  internally represented as /minimal acyclic deterministic

  finite-state automata/.


  The library allows to build DAWGs from words over any alphabet

  providing an `Ord` instance.

  It also provides a fast insert operation which can be used to

  build DAWGs on-the-fly.'

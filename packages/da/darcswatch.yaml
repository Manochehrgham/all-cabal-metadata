description: ! 'DarcsWatch is a tool to track the state of darcs patches

  that have been submitted to some project, usually by

  using the "darcs send" command. It allows both submitters

  and project maintainers to get an overview of patches that

  have been submitted but not yet applied. Some notable features are:


  * Reads both darcs1 and darcs2.0 (hashed) format repositories.


  * Displays patch summaries per user and per repository.


  * Patch diff can be reviewed directly.


  * Download link for each patch, to apply without searching for the email.


  * Knows about inverse and amend-recorded patches and uses them to consider


  * Integrates into http://bugs.darcs.net/


  * Optionally sends out mails to mailing lists when a patch is applied to a repository

  patches obsolete.'

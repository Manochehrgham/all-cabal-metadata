description: ! 'The library provides data types which can be used to represent

  forest structures with labels stored in internal nodes and

  words kept in leaves.  In particular, those types are well suited

  for representing the layer of named entities (NEs).


  The IOB method is implemented in the Data.Named.IOB module and can

  be used to translate between a forest of entities and a sequence

  of compound IOB labels.  This method can be used together with a

  sequence classifier to indirectly model forest structures.


  The Data.Named.Graph module can be used to represent more general,

  graph structures of entities.  The module provides also a lossy

  conversion from a DAG to a disjoint forest of entities.'

description-type: haddock
description: In some contexts, forests (collections of zero or more trees) are more
  important than trees. The /data-forest/ library provides a @Tree@ type much like
  the one from the popular /containers/ library, but it also provides a @Forest@ type
  with its own @Functor@ and @Foldable@ instances.

description: This project is meant to be a compiler feature/wrapper that analyzes
  your code and chooses the best data structure depending on your source code. It
  analyzes the functions used on a wildcard data structure and chooses the type of
  structure that minimizes the time complexity. It will support C language and hopefully
  some other languages too.

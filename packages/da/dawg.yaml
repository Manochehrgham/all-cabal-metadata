description: ! 'The library implements /directed acyclic word graphs/ (DAWGs) internally

  represented as /minimal acyclic deterministic finite-state automata/.


  The "Data.DAWG.Dynamic" module provides fast insert and delete operations

  which can be used to build the automaton on-the-fly.  The automaton from

  the "Data.DAWG.Static" module has lower memory footprint and provides

  static hashing functionality.'

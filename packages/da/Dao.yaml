description: ! 'The Dao modules and interactive program is a meta programming language

  intended for artificial intelligence uses. It is very much like the

  classic UNIX "AWK" scripting language, but instead of using POSIX-style

  regular epxressions, the patterns used in Dao are designed to more easily

  match natural language input.'

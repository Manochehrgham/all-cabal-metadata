description: ! 'Provides functionality similar to that of the `Show` class: Taking
  some

  arbitrary value and returning a String.


  * Output is not intended to be valid haskell.


  * Requires a `Data.Data.Data` instance instead of a `Text.Show` one.


  * Output, if large, is often easier to parse than `show` output

  due to the formatting as a nested tree.


  * The user can adapt the behaviour at runtime using custom layouting

  expressed via syb-style extension.'

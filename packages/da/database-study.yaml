description: ! 'This package consists of some toy modules

  that translate the well-known company database example.

  We show how to implement various queries and database updates

  in a way that is both simple and clean.

  It is recommended to download the package with @cabal fetch@,

  extract it in a local directory and run @make ghci@.

  Additionally open a text editor and follow the examples in the @Example@ directory.

  The first queries in the modules

  "Example.RelationalAlgebra" and "Example.QueryMonad"

  are the same but in different styles.'

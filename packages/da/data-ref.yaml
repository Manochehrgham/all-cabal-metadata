description: ! 'This package provides a unique interface to both STRef and IORef.

  The advantage is that it is plain Haskell 98,

  the disadvantage is that we cannot use STRef and IORef as they are.


  Our approach works with Haskell 98 single parameter type classes

  because we use an explicit dictionary,

  and we do not pass the references around but their accessors.


  Similar packages: @reference@, @ref-mtl@, @ref-fd@, @ref-tf@.'

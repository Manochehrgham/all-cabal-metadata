description: ! 'An efficient implementation of maps from strings to arbitrary values.

  Values can associated with an arbitrary byte key.

  Searching for keys is very fast, but

  the prefix tree probably consumes more memory than

  "Data.Map". The main differences are the special

  ''prefixFind'' functions, which can be used to perform prefix queries.'

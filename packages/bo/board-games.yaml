description: ! 'Three games that might run as CGI script in a web server:

  Connect Four, Rows&Columns, Mastermind


  Check running versions at

  <http://www.henning-thielemann.de/VierGewinnt> and

  <http://www.henning-thielemann.de/ZeilenSpalten>.


  You can build an example web server by installing with


  > cabal install board-games -fbuildExamples


  Then start the server with


  > ./dist/build/board-games/board-games


  and play the games in your browser at the URL

  <http://localhost:8080/>.


  Currently the games use German texts.

  I wanted to use gettext, but this is not thread-safe.'

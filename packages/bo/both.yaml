description: ! 'The Monoid instance for Maybe behaves like so:


  > instance Monoid a => Monoid (Maybe a) where

  >   mappend (Just x) (Just y) = Just $ x <> y

  >   mappend (Just x) Nothing  = Just x

  >   mappend Nothing  (Just y) = Just y

  >   mappend Nothing  Nothing  = Nothing

  >

  >   mempty = Nothing


  Both is a newtype wrapper around Maybe providing this instance:


  > instance Monoid a => Monoid (Both a) where

  >   mappend (Just x) (Just y) = Just $ x <> y

  >   mappend _ _ = Nothing

  >

  >   mempty = Just mempty'

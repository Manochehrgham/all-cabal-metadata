description: Bounded TChan's, or BTChan's, are a transactional queue with a limit
  to the number of elements (further calls to @writeBTChan@ or @unGetBTChan@ call
  STM retry).  Users are strongly encouraged to consider using the more complete 'stm-chans'
  packages, which includes a bounded TChan designed on this package.

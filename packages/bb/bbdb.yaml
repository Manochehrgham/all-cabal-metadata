description: ! 'BBDB (http://sourceforge.bbdb.net) is a contact management utility

  that can be used with emacs.  It stores its data internally as a lisp

  expression.  This module parses the lisp and provides some convenience

  functions to get at and manipulate the data all from within Haskell.

  See the hackage docs for usage and examples.'

description: ! 'This package provides methods for fully evaluating data structures

  (\"deep evaluation\"). Deep evaluation is often used for adding

  strictness to a program, e.g. in order to force pending exceptions,

  remove space leaks, or force lazy I/O to happen. It is also useful

  in parallel programs, to ensure pending work does not migrate to the

  wrong thread.


  The primary use of this package is via the ''deepseq'' function, a

  \"deep\" version of ''seq''. It is implemented on top of an ''NFData''

  typeclass (\"Normal Form Data\", data structures with no unevaluated

  components) which defines strategies for fully evaluating different

  data types.'

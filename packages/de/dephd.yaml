description: ! 'dephd - A simple tool for base calling and quality appraisal.


  Reads files in phd-format (phred output), either specified individually,

  or in a directory (use the --input-dirs option to read directories

  or --input-list to read from an index file).  Can also read FASTA with an

  associated quality file.


  Can trim according to Lucy or Phred parameters, can mask by quality, can plot

  graphs (via gnuplot) of sequence quality to a window, or to JPG/EPS files.  Can

  categorize sequences according to overall quality.  Also constructs files suitable
  for

  submission to dbEST.  More information at <http://blog.malde.org/index.php/2010/09/07/submitting-ests-upstream/>.


  Also provides ''fakequal'', a utility to generate bogus quality values,

  which are sometimes needed by less flexible tools.


  The Darcs repository is at <http://malde.org/~ketil/biohaskell/dephd>.'

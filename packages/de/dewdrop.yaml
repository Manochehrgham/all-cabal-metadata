description: ! 'Traditional buffer-overflow attacks work by filling a data buffer
  with

  exploit code and then redirecting execution to that buffer.  As a

  countermeasure, modern operating systems will forbid (by default) the

  execution of writable memory regions.


  Return-oriented programming [1] is an alternative exploitation strategy

  that works around this restriction.  The exploit payload is built by

  chaining together short code sequences (\"gadgets\") which are already

  present in the exploited program, and thus are allowed to be executed.


  dewdrop is a Haskell library for finding useful gadgets in 32- and 64-bit

  x86 ELF binaries.  You can describe the desired gadget properties with a

  Haskell function, and use the @Dewdrop@ module to make a customized

  gadget-finder program.  Or you can import @Dewdrop.Analyze@ and integrate

  this functionality into a larger program.

description: ! 'deka provides decimal floating point arithmetic.  It is based on

  mpdecimal, the C library used to provide support for the Decimal

  module in Python 3.


  You will need to install mpdecimal to use deka; otherwise your

  executables will not link.  It is available at


  <http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal/>


  mpdecimal has also been packaged for some Linux distributions,

  such as Debian (libmpdec-dev - available in Jessie and later) and

  Arch (mpdecimal).


  mpdecimal, in turn, implements the General Decimal Arithmetic

  Specification, which is available at


  <http://speleotrove.com/decimal/>


  For more on deka, please see the Github home page at


  <https://github.com/massysett/deka>


  This package contains only tests, so that other packages

  may also use the tests.'

description: ! 'Debugging a problem over email is slow, tedious, and hard. The developer

  needs to see your problem to understand it. Debug-me aims to make debugging

  fast, fun, and easy, by letting the developer access your computer remotely,

  so they can immediately see and interact with the problem. Making your

  problem their problem gets it fixed fast.


  A debug-me session is logged and signed with the developer''s GnuPG

  key, producing a chain of evidence of what they saw and what they did.

  So the developer''s good reputation is leveraged to make debug-me secure.


  When you start debug-me without any options, it will connect to a debug-me

  server, and print out an url that you can give to the developer to get

  them connected to you. Then debug-me will show you their GnuPG key and who

  has signed it. If the developer has a good reputation, you can proceed

  to let them type into your console in a debug-me session. Once the

  session is done, the debug-me server will email you the signed

  evidence of what the developer did in the session.


  If the developer did do something bad, you''d have proof that they cannot

  be trusted, which you can share with the world. Knowing that is the case

  will keep most developers honest.'

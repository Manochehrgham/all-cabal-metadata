description: ! 'The `detrospector'' program generates random text conforming to the
  general

  style and diction of a given source document.  It associates each

  `k''-character substring of the source document with a probability

  distribution for the next character.  These distributions are used to

  iteratively pick new characters for output.  In other words, it samples a

  Markov chain derived from the source document.


  Run `detrospector'' `-?'' for usage information.  The program has several

  modes.  It can generate random text, or invent individual random words which

  are not found in a dictionary.  These modes require a chain file, which is

  built from a source document in another mode.


  Design goals include speed and full Unicode support.  I welcome suggestions

  and patches regarding any aspect of this program.


  New in version 0.3:


  * Compatible with @hashable@ 1.2'

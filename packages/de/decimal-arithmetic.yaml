description: ! "\nGeneral Decimal Arithmetic\n==========================\n\nThis is
  a decimal arithmetic package for Haskell, suitable for\narbitrary-precision decimal
  floating point and integer calculations.\n\nFor details and the specification on
  which the implementation is based, see\nMike Cowlishaw's [General Decimal Arithmetic][].\n\n
  \ [General Decimal Arithmetic]: http://speleotrove.com/decimal/\n\nWhile usable,
  the implementation is currently in its infancy. Additional\noperations as well as
  an API for manipulating context flags are planned.\n"

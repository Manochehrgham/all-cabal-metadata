description: ! 'This package provides a "GHC.Generics"-based

  ''Control.DeepSeq.Generics.genericRnf'' function which can be used

  for providing a ''rnf'' implementation. See the documentation for

  the ''genericRnf'' function in the "Control.DeepSeq.Generics" module

  to get started.


  The original idea was pioneered in the @generic-deepseq@ package

  (see <http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2012-February/099551.html>

  for more information).


  This package differs from the @generic-deepseq@ package by working

  in combination with the existing @deepseq@ package as opposed to

  defining a conflicting drop-in replacement for @deepseq@''s

  @Control.Deepseq@ module.


  Note: The ability to auto-derive via "GHC.Generics" has been

  merged into @deepseq-1.4.0.0@. This package is now still useful

  for writing code that''s also compatible with older @deepseq@

  versions not yet providing "GHC.Generics"-support.'

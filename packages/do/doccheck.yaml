description: ! 'This tool aims to detect any common pitfalls that is often seen in
  documentation generated with Haddock,

  commonly caused by lack of familiarity with the markup or time to review the generated
  documentation.

  Extending this tool is rather simple (add parsers) and can be easily used to judge
  the impact of

  changing Haddock''s parsing rules.'

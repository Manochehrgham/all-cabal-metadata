description: ! 'A library that performs fast, accurate conversion between double

  precision floating point and text.


  This library is implemented as bindings to the C++

  @double-conversion@ library written by Florian Loitsch at Google:

  <http://code.google.com/p/double-conversion/>.


  The ''Text'' versions of these functions are about 30 times faster

  than the default ''show'' implementation for the ''Double'' type.


  The ''ByteString'' versions are /slower/ than the ''Text'' versions;

  roughly half the speed.  (This seems to be due to the cost of

  allocating ''ByteString'' values via @malloc@.)


  As a final note, be aware that the @bytestring-show@ package is

  about 50% slower than simply using ''show''.'

description: ! 'Dungeons of Wor is a homage to the classic arcade game, Wizard of

  Wor.  It uses the artwork and levels from the Astrocade version, but

  the gameplay mechanics differ from the original in several ways.


  This game is also an experiment in functional reactive programming,

  so it might be a useful resource to anyone interested in this topic.

  It was coded using the simple version of Elerea, which provides

  discrete streams as first-class values.'

description: ! 'docidx is a small tool which creates an HTML index of your

  installed Haskell packages, with links to each package''s Haddock

  docs locally and on Hackage.  While "cabal install" now creates

  and maintains an index by module, sometimes it''s nice to have this

  other view (and the quick links to Hackage).

  docidx queries your global and user package databases (via

  ghc-pkg, via the Cabal package), to build an index of all

  installed packages - including version numbers where more than one

  version is present, package synopses, links to the local Haddock

  docs, and a link to the package on Hackage.

  Packages are grouped by first letter, and there''s an A-Z index at

  the top of the page, which can be easily extended via a config

  file to include extra links you think are handy - e.g. to the

  per-module index, to local ghc documentation, to the Haskell

  report, etc. - whatever you want).'

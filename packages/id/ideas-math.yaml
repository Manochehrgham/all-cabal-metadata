description: ! 'Interactive domain reasoner for logic and mathematics, based on the

  feedback services of the Ideas framework. Domains supported include

  propositional logic (disjunctive normal form and equivalence proofs),

  mathematics (fractions, polynomial equations, powers, derivatives),

  linear algebra (Gaussian elimination and linear systems), and relation

  algebra. The domain reasoner is used by learning environments such as

  the digital mathematical environment of the Freudenthal Institute, MathDox,

  ActiveMath, and the LogEx logic tool.'

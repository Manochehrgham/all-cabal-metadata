synopsis: Feedback services for intelligent tutoring systems
changelog: ! "Changelog ideas-1.3.1 => ideas.1.4\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*
  refactoring of strategies\n  - strategies are now represented cyclic trees (that
  preserve fixpoints)\n  - new strategy combinators can be defined outside the framework\n
  \ - simpler interfaces: no more Builder, Step, and Core datatypes\n  - nice speed-up
  for constructing and running strategies\n  \n* support for new database schema (v2)
  with more columns\n  - request can have an optional 'logging' attribute (false,
  v1, v2)\n  - command-line flag for seeing information that is logged \n  - userid,
  sessionid, and taskid are stored in a state\n\n* changing license to Apache License
  version 2.0 (was: GPL)\n* renaming strategy combinators (eg .*.) to solve clash
  with Applicative.<*> \n* adding SyntaxError constructor to Diagnose datatype\n*
  added read instance for Difficulty\n* changed newline and tab escaping in JSON\n*
  re-implemented atomic combinator\n* introduced inits combinator  (initial prefixes)
  and atomic prefix (!~>)\n* introduced somewhereWhen traversal combinator\n* added
  cabal flag to resolve dependency on network >= 2.6\n* added cabal flag to enable
  support for logging"

description: ! 'Ideas (Interactive Domain-specific Exercise Assistants) is a joint
  research

  project between the Open University of the Netherlands and Utrecht

  University. The project''s goal is to use software and compiler technology to

  build state-of-the-art components for intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and

  learning environments. The ''ideas'' software package provides a generic

  framework for constructing the expert knowledge module (also known as a

  domain reasoner) for an ITS or learning environment. Domain knowledge is

  offered as a set of feedback services that are used by external tools such

  as the digital mathematical environment (DME), MathDox, and the Math-Bridge

  system. We have developed several domain reasoners based on this framework,

  including reasoners for mathematics, linear algebra, logic, learning Haskell

  (the Ask-Elle programming tutor) and evaluating Haskell expressions, and for

  practicing communication skills (the serious game Communicate!).'

description: ! 'Easy to use backup tool utilizing cloud services (S3 only right now)
  as backup storage.

  bkr is in very early development stage. Right now bkr is rather a synchronization
  then a backup utility. bkr uploads files from wanted folders to a remote storage
  service, next time it runs it checks for changes and uploads new or altered files
  but does not keep copies of altered files (hence rather synchronization then backup).
  For more information about installation and setup, release notes and more please
  visit https:\/\/github.com\/ingesson\/bkr. All suggestions and bug reports are of
  course more then welcome.'

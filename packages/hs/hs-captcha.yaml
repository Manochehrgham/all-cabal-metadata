description: ! 'Generates images suitable for use as CAPTCHAs in online web-form security.  Does
  not

  integrate with any web framework; simply exports a function that creates the image

  itself as a ByteString (containing a PNG), and the correct answer to the challenge
  as a

  String.  HS-Captcha is designed to be as simple as possible to integrate in other

  frameworks.'

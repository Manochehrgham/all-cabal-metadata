description: ! 'This library provides an asynchronous DNS resolver on top

  of GNU ADNS <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/>.

  Not all options are supported, but A, MX, and PTR lookups

  work nicely. There is also support for retrieving generic

  RR types, CNAMEs, and for NSEC zone walking. The library

  can be expected to work with fine ADNS 1.4 or later. It

  might also work with version ADNS 1.3, but that hasn''t

  been tested.


  The example program adns-reverse-lookup.hs demonstrates

  how the resolver is used. Given a list of host names on

  the command line, it performs an A/PTR double-lookup and

  checks whether the records are consistent. The

  output is printed in the order in which the DNS responses

  arrive:


  > $ ./adns-reverse-lookup cryp.to localhost www.example.com

  > OK: localhost <-> 127.0.0.1

  > FAIL: cryp.to -> 217.19.183.102 -> ["zuse.cryp.to"]

  > OK: www.example.com <-> 192.0.32.10'

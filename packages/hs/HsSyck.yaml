description: ! 'This is a simple YAML (''Yet Another Markup Language'') processor,

  used by the Pugs project for handling data serialization; this can be

  useful for optimization and caching purposes.


  This is an interface to the @syck@ C library for parsing and

  dumping YAML data. It lets you transform textual YAML data into an

  object of type ''YamlNode'', and vice versa, fast.'

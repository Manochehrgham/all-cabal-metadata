description: ! 'Hspresent is a simple program that lets you give powerpoint-like presentations

  in your terminal (for certain definitions of powerpoint-like). It''s extremely

  basic and unintelligent. Don''t expect much.


  Invoke like `hspresent /path/to/your/presentation`. Left and right arrow keys

  move between slides, and hitting `q` or `Ctrl-C` quits the presentation.


  The file format is really simple right now. Slides are separated by lines

  consisting of the characters `--`. You can put the single character `.` on a

  line to demarcate a split frame. A split frame really creates a new frame with

  the contents of the previous frame copied at the front (this is similar to how

  beamer works).'

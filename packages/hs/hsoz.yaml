description: ! "# Oz Haskell Implementation\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rvl/hsoz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rvl/hsoz)
  [![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/hsoz.svg)]()\n\n*hsoz* is a Haskell
  implementation of the Iron, Hawk, and Oz web\nauthentication protocols. These protocols
  originate from the OAuth2\nstandardisation process, but are designed to be simpler
  to implement\nfor the common case of web applications.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn
  the words of their principal designer:\n\n**Iron** is a cryptographic utility for
  sealing a JSON object using\nsymmetric key encryption with message integrity verification.
  Or in\nother words, it lets you encrypt an object, send it around (in\ncookies,
  authentication credentials, etc.), then receive it back and\ndecrypt it. The algorithm
  ensures that the message was not tampered\nwith, and also provides a simple mechanism
  for password rotation.\n\n**Hawk** is an HTTP authentication scheme using a message\nauthentication
  code (MAC) algorithm to provide partial HTTP request\ncryptographic verification.\n\n**Oz**
  is a web authorization protocol based on industry best\npractices. Oz combines the
  Hawk authentication protocol with the\nIron encryption protocol to provide a simple
  to use and secure\nsolution for granting and authenticating third-party access to
  an\nAPI on behalf of a user or an application.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe Haddock
  documentation is on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsoz)\nand at https://rodney.id.au/docs/hsoz/.\n\n
  * [Network.Iron](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsoz/docs/Network-Iron.html)\n
  * [Network.Hawk](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsoz/docs/Network-Hawk.html)\n
  * [Network.Oz](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsoz/docs/Network-Oz.html)\n\n##
  Example Usage\n\nSee the [Network.Iron](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsoz/docs/Network-Iron.html)\ndocumentation,
  and the [example](./example/) directory of this\nrepository.\n\n## Status\n\nThis
  is an in-progress experiment in implementing the protocol in\nHaskell.\n\n * **Iron**:
  complete and tested.\n * **Hawk**: complete, test suite under development.\n * **Oz**:
  under construction.\n * **Example web application**: under construction.\n\n*Please
  note*: until the example application is built, this library\ncannot be considered
  \"battle-tested\".\n\nThere is also an `org-mode` file: [todo.org](./todo.org?raw=1).\n\n##
  Development\n\nI welcome collaborators, particularly anyone who would like to develop\nauthentication
  plugins for frameworks such as\n[Snap](http://snapframework.com/) and\n[Servant](https://haskell-servant.github.io/).\n\n###
  Building with Stack\n\n```\nstack build\n```\n\n### Building with Nix\n\n```\nnix-shell
  -p cabal2nix --command \"cabal2nix --shell . > default.nix\"\nnix-shell --command
  \"cabal configure\"\ncabal build\n```\n\n## Credits\n\nThis module is based on the
  Javascript code and documentation by Eran\nHammer and others. A fair amount of Hammer's
  descriptive text has been\nincorporated into this documentation, as well as the
  cool logos.\n"

synopsis: A preprocessor that helps with writing Haskell bindings to C code
changelog: ! "## 0.68.1\n\n - Fix type signature of generated `main` test function\n
  \  to avoid C compiler warnings about unused `argc`/`argv`\n   function parameters
  during feature testing.\n\n - Double-escape paths used to build call to `hsc_line`\n
  \  ([#12504](http://ghc.haskell.org/ticket/12504))\n\n"

description: ! 'The hsc2hs program can be used to automate some parts of the

  process of writing Haskell bindings to C code.  It reads an

  almost-Haskell source file with embedded special constructs, and

  outputs a real Haskell file with these constructs processed, based

  on information taken from some C headers.  The extra constructs

  provide Haskell counterparts of C types, values of C constants,

  including sizes of C types, and access to fields of C structs.

description: ! 'The hsc2hs program can be used to automate some parts of the

  process of writing Haskell bindings to C code.  It reads an

  almost-Haskell source file with embedded special constructs, and

  outputs a real Haskell file with these constructs processed, based

  on information taken from some C headers.  The extra constructs

  provide Haskell counterparts of C types, values of C constants,

  including sizes of C types, and access to fields of C structs.

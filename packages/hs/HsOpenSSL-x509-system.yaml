description: ! 'A cross-platform library that tries to find a (reasonable) CA certificate

  bundle that can be used with @HsOpenSSL@ to verify the certificates of

  remote peers.


  This package is for @HsOpenSSL@ what @x509-system@ is for the @tls@ package.

  Additionally, it borrows some ideas from @x509-system@.'

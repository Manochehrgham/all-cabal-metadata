description: ! 'This is an implementation of the Nock 5K spec with an accompanying

  interpreter.


  Nock is a tiny stateless virtual machine that can be thought of

  as a functional assembly language. Nock is the lowest layer in

  the Urbit stack. On top of it rests the Hoon language, in which

  the Arvo OS is written.

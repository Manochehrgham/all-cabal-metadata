description: ! 'hslogger is a logging framework for Haskell, roughly similar to

  Python''s logging module.


  hslogger lets each log message have a priority and source be associated

  with it.  The programmer can then define global handlers that route

  or filter messages based on the priority and source.  hslogger also

  has a syslog handler built in.'

description: ! 'The growing self organising map (GSOM) algorithm is a clustering algorithm

  working on a set of n-dimensional numeric input vectors. It''s output is a

  network of nodes laid out in two dimensions where each node has a weight

  vector associated with it. This weight vector has the same dimension as the

  input vectors and is meant to be intepreted as a cluster center, i.e. it

  represents those input vectors whose distance to the node''s weight vector

  is minimal when compared to the distance to the other nodes weight vectors.

  See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSOM> for an explanation of the algorithm.

  The algorithm was introduced in:

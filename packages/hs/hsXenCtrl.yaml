description: ! 'FFI bindings to xenctrl.h and perhaps more.

  The System.Xen.CBindings should provide direct access

  to the C API while System.Xen will eventually provide

  a higher level abstraction.  This library binding

  allows pure haskell programs to use XenCtrl functions;

  these can be Haskell versions of xend, xm, and

  virt-manager but more interesting projects are possible.

  Think about a happs app controlling domains and complex

  policy controls on resource (CPU, memory, PCI) uses.'

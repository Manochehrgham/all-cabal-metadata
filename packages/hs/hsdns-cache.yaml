  Caching asynchronous DNS resolver built on top of

  GNU ADNS <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/>.


  * Resolves several IP addresses for one host (if available)

  in round-robin fashion.


  * Throttles number of parallel requests (so DNS resolving continues to work

  even under heavy load).


  * Errors are cached too (for one minute).


  * Handles CNAMEs (@hsdns@ returns error for them).


  This cache is tested in a long running web-crawler

  (used in <https://bazqux.com>) so it should be safe to use it in real world

  applications.'

description: ! '@hs-dotnet@ integrates the .NET platform with Haskell (via GHC.)


  It lets you interact with .NET code and libraries, providing full access

  to .NET objects in a type-safe manner. This also includes parameterized .NET

  types (/generic types/), representing them in a manner natural to Haskell.


  Dually, Haskell functions can be accessed and called from .NET, @hs-dotnet@

  transparently exposing these as delegates for you. Two example uses of this

  facility are the use of Haskell when programming LINQ and in Windows Forms

  UIs. Here''s how to fire up an example program accessing LINQ:


  > c:\haskell> cd examples

  > c:\haskell> ghci LinqQuery.hs

  > ....

  > LinqQuery> whereQuery


  The package also includes tool support for automatically generating Haskell

  wrappers and types to .NET classes. The package assumes at least v2.0 of

  the .NET framework.

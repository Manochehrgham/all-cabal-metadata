description: ! 'Judy bindings (a C library that implements fast sparse dynamic

  arrays) for Haskell presenting APIs conforming as much as possible to the

  existent Haskell library interfaces, like Data.Map and Data.Array.MArray.

  This binding for the Judy library includes all its four types: mapping from

  words to bits (Judy1), from words to values (JudyL), from strings to values

  (JudyHS) and from array-of-bytes to values (JudyHS).'

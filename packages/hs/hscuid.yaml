  This module does not use crypto-strength sources of

  randomness.

  Use at your own peril!


  For better or worse, this module uses semantic versioning

  (see <http://semver.org/>).

  That is, if you want to depend upon, for example, version 1

  of the API, you should add hscuid ==1.* to your Cabal

  file. No breaking changes will be (deliberately) introduced

  under that version number.'

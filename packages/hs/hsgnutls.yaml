description: ! 'hsgnutls is a wrapper to the GNU TLS Library.

  Currently it is in quite early stages but offers client functionality

  and parts of the server-side interface. Anonymous and X509 authentication

  is supported, but SRP and OpenPGP will appear in a future version.

  hsgnutls uses the attribute implementation borrowed from Gtk2Hs.


  Note this is not the official hsgnutls, but rather a fork updated for the needs

  of the Barracuda ad-hoc chat client, which repo can be found at

  <http://repos.mroot.net/sep07-adhoc>.'

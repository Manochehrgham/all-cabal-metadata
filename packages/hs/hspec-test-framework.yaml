description: ! 'A `test-framework` compatibility layer on top of Hspec, it

  allows you to run `test-framework` tests with Hspec

  unmodified.


  All that is required is to remove


  * `test-framework`


  * `test-framework-quickcheck2`


  * `test-framework-hunit`


  * `test-framework-th`


  from the `build-depends` section of your cabal file and add


  * `hspec-test-framework`


  * `hspec-test-framework-th`


  in theire place.


  NOTE: The packages `hspec-test-framework` and

  `hspec-test-framework-th` are hidden by default, so that they

  do not interfere with an installed version of

  `test-framework`.  If you want to use them with e.g. `ghci`,

  you have to pass the command-line flags

  @-packagehspec-test-framework -packagehspec-test-framework-th@

  to GHC.'

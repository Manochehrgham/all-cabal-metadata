description: ! 'Upload a video to YouTube via YouTube API.

  The aim of this program is to simplify uploads of related videos.


  First you must have the @curl@ executable installed.


  In order to use the @youtube-upload@ command

  you need a YouTube account and an additional developer account.

  From the developer account you get a keyfile.

  If you want to upload videos you first have to login to YouTube.

  You can do this with


  > youtube-auth your_youtube_login


  or


  > export YOUTUBEUSER=your_youtube_login

  > youtube-auth


  As a result of this call you get an authentication token.

  Write this authentication token into the @YOUTUBEAUTH@ environment variable.

  It is queried by @youtube-upload@.

  For every upload you have to pass the developer keyfile,

  an XML file containing meta data for the video and the video file.


  The XML file must be encoded with UTF-8.

  I found it very useful to generate the XML files

  from an XML template file and a CSV table

  using the @cvsreplace@ command from the @spreadsheet@ package.

  I have included the example file @upload-template.xml@

  that you can use with a CSV file

  with the columns @TITLE@, @DESCRIPTION@, @CATEGORY@, @TAGS@.'

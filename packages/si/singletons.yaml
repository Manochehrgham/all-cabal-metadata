description: ! 'This library generates singleton types, promoted functions, and singleton

  functions using Template Haskell. It is useful for programmers who wish

  to use dependently typed programming techniques. The library was originally

  presented in /Dependently Typed Programming with Singletons/, published

  at the Haskell Symposium, 2012.

  (<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2012/singletons/paper.pdf>)

  Version 1.0 and onwards works a lot harder to promote functions. See the

  paper published at Haskell Symposium, 2014:

  <http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2014/promotion/promotion.pdf>.'

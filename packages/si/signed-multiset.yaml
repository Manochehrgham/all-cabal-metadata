description: ! 'Multisets (or bags) are sets in which elements may occur more than
  once.

  The number of times an element occurs in a multiset is called its

  /multiplicity/.


  This package provides an efficient implementation of so-called

  /signed multisets/ (also known as hybrid sets or shadow sets), which

  generalise multisets by allowing for /negative membership/.

  That is, elements in a signed multiset can have negative multiplicities.

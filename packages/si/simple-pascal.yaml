description: ! 'This package provides a compiler for simplified variant of Pascal
  language.

  That language includes conditional statements, for loops, procedures and

  functions. But it does not support complex data types (only integer, string

  and boolean are supported currently).

  This compiler outputs bytecode which may be run by SSVM (see simple-stacked-vm

  package).'

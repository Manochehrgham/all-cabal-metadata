description: ! 'simpleprelude provides an alternative Prelude

  module for teaching as well as wrappers for ghc,

  and ghci to use them.


  The simplified Prelude omits the type classes

  Num, Integral, and Ord. Instead it provides

  monomorphically typed arithmetic operators on

  Integer.


  It also provides two executables: simple-ghc and

  simple-ghci which are wrappers around ghc and

  ghci. They are pre-configured to use the Prelude

  module of this library instead of base''s Prelude

  module.


  Release History:


  - 1.0.1.3: Bugfix concerning conditional expressions

  - 1.0.1.1: Fixing missing operator precedences

  - 1.0.1.0: Add a Haskell pre-processor to restore

  the feel of an implicityly imported Prelude although

  we use -XNoImplicitPrelude.'

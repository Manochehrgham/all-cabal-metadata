description: ! 'Inspired by the RubyGem of the same name, this package allows you
  to

  easily build validating forms that infer defaults based on type.


  Most users will want to both render ''Html'' and parse input, and so

  should use the SimpleForm.Digestive.Combined and SimpleForm.Combined

  modules.'

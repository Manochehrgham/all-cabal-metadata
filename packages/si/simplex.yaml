description: ! 'A simple markup language that translates to LaTeX


  See the PDF included in the cabal tarball to see

  how Simplex works.


  [@v0.3.4@]

  Removed dependency on the deprecated @old-time@ package,

  using @time@ instead now.


  [@v0.3.5@]

  Enhanced the documentation, added the simplex source of

  it in doc (see the source tarball). Added @letter@.


  [@v0.3.6@]

  Relaxed dependencies so the package will work with

  the Haskell Platform 2012.2.0.0 too (thats the one in

  Debian 7.0).


  [@v0.3.7@]

  Better documentation.


  [@v0.3.8@]

  Added @--symbols@ command line switch.

  Added @ent@ to the list of dirty extensions.'

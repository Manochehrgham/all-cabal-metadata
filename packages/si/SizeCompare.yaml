description: ! 'SizeCompare is a small library providing size comparison functions
  standard Haskell data-types.

  Size compare runs in O(min(n,m)) for both arguments, possibly faster.

  Instead of measuring both containers and comparing the result, SizeCompare iteratively
  deconstructs both

  sides of the equality equation until a conclusion can be made.

  A common expression like:

  length xs > 0

  runs O(n) in the length of the list. Sizecompare runs (O(1)) in this particular
  case:

  xs |>| 0

  This is still an initial version of the library and updates may follow after some
  more profiling.'

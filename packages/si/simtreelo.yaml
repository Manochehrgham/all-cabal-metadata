description: ! "Introduction\n============\n\nA library capable of loading a tree
  (a forest, actually) from a file. This tree is meant to be human-readable, with
  a free (as long as it is consistent) indentation style.\n\nSimtree format\n===============\n\nA
  Simtree must be organized in such a way that every child is one indentation deeper
  than its parent, and all siblings have the same indentation.\nThe String used for
  indentation is inferred from the first indentation depth.\nThe entire first line
  (except the newline character) represents the beginning of a comment.\n\nExample
  file:\n\n\t#\n\tA\n\t\tB\n\t\tC\n\tD\n\t\tE\n\t\t\tF\n\t\t\t\tG\n\tH\n"

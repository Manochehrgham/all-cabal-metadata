description: ! '@simple-conduit@ follows a similar UI to the more capable @conduit@
  library,

  but reduces the scope of what it can solve down to what can be expressed by

  chaining monadic folds that allow for early termination.  This allows for

  more predictable resource management behavior, at the cost of not allowing

  scenarios that @conduit@ is better designed.'

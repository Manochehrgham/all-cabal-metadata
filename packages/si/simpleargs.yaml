description: ! 'The provided getArgs returns an arbitrary tuple of values instead
  of a

  list of Strings.  This means that the number and type (i.e. parseability)

  of parameters are checked, and reported to the user.  The module is not

  a substitute for proper error handling (use "System.Console.GetOpt" for that),

  but is useful for making quick and dirty command line tools a bit less dirty,

  without sacrificing the quick part.'

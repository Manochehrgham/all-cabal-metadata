description: ! 'Sifflet is a visual, functional programming language.

  Sifflet users can make programs by drawing diagrams

  to connect functions and other units.

  Sifflet show the intermediate steps of the computation

  on the diagram, and can expand function calls to show further details.

  It is intended as an aid for learning about recursion.'

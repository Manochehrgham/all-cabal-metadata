description: ! 'This library provides a very simple C like AST and conversion type
  classes. The classes use GHC.Generics and default signatures so you can painless
  convert to and from Haskell types.

  This is not a library for parsing C. There are plenty of great ones on Hackage though.
  This is meant to make the process of converting from a non-recursive Haskell value
  to a C value easier for data serialization tasks.'

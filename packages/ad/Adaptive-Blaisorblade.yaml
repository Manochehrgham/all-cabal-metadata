description: ! 'This is a Haskell (plus some extensions) implementation

  of a library for incremental computing.  It closely

  follows the implementation in the nice POPL 2002 paper

  "Adaptive Functional Programming", by Umut Acar,

  Guy Blelloch and Bob Harper.

  This is a small fork of the original library named

  "Adaptive", with the same interface but small adaptations

  to GHC 7.4.'

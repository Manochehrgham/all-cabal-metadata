description: ! 'ADPfusion combines stream-fusion (using the stream interface

  provided by the vector library) and type-level programming to

  provide highly efficient dynamic programming combinators.


  ADPfusion allows writing dynamic programs for single- and

  multi-tape problems. Inputs can be sequences, or sets. And new

  input types can be defined, without having to rewrite this

  library thanks to the open-world assumption of ADPfusion.


  The library provides the machinery for Outside and Ensemble

  algorithms as well. Ensemble algorithms combine Inside and

  Outside calculations.


  The homepage provides a number of tutorial-style examples, with

  linear and context-free grammars over sequence and set inputs.


  Ideas implemented here are described in a couple of papers:

description: ! 'WAI Request Spec is a declarative validation layer for HTTP

  requests. It aims to make error-handling for malformed requests as

  easy as taking the happy path.


  A brief summary of the core features:


  * Can specify headers and query params as input sources


  * Support for parsing ints, floats, text, bytes (with encodings), and bools


  * A parser combinator interface for chaining together request requirements


  * Support for Alternatives


  * Support for optional parameters


  * Convenient and informative default error messages that let service

  consumers know what went wrong


  It is built on WAI, so it is compatible with several Haskell

  web frameworks. All you need is the ability to access the Request

  object, and WAI Request Spec takes care of the rest!'

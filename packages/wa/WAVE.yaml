description: ! '# WAVE format audio file IO library

  Copyright &copy; 2008-2014 Bart Massey


  This library provides `Data.WAVE`, a module for reading and

  writing audio files in the

  [WAVE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) audio file format.

  See the Haddock documentation for the gory details.


  This is definitely a simple implementation: a number of

  "advanced" WAVE features are not supported (such as

  nonlinear encodings), and non-WAVE audio files are in no way

  supported.  I thought others might find it useful, though. I

  also have released other code that depends on it.

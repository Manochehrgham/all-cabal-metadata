description: ! 'Provides a generic, cookie-based middleware for sessions that is

  parameterised over the session store, the cookie name, and the

  cookie parameters (such as path, expiry, etc).  Passes a pair of

  functions (lookup key, set key) for the current session through the

  ''Vault'' in the ''Request''.


  Also provides a simple example session store based on threadsafe

  ''IORef''s and ''Data.Map''.


  See example/Main.hs in git for example usage.'

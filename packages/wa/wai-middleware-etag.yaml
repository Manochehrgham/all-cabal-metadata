description: ! 'WAI middleware that attaches ETags to responses for static files

  if they exist.


  Caveats:


  If caching is turned on, the middleware caches calculated checksums

  aggressively in a synchronized hashmap; checksums are calculated only

  once, so changes on the file-system are not reflected until the server

  is restarted.


  This middleware only calculates ETag checksums for file smaller than 1MB,

  otherwise it attaches a last-modified tag to the response.

description: ! "3DWaves\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThis is a personal project, still in its
  infancy, and I don't expect anybody else to use it. Should somehow happen upon this
  site, I would however welcome their support and feedback.\r\n\r\n##Contents\r\nWavefront
  OBJ parsers and related amenities. Includes purely functional parsers\r\nand IO
  utilities for loading models from files.\r\n\r\nSupports the basic MTL and OBJ attributes.
  My ambition is to add full support for the entire specification.\r\n\r\nPlease note
  that this package is completely unaware of rendering and graphics. The data structures
  generated by the parsers are oblivious to technologies such as Direct3D and OpenGL;
  creating eg. GPU buffers is up to the client.\r\n\r\nI may at some point implement
  the FFI and add direct OpenGL support, in separate modules.\r\n\r\n##Maintainers\r\nJonatan
  H Sundqvist\r\n\r\n##TODO\r\nThere is currently no standalone list of tasks (cf.
  source files).\r\n- Use Parsec instead (branch off) (?)\r\n- Add sample models and
  demos\r\n- Add profiling and checks\r\n- GHCi support\r\n"

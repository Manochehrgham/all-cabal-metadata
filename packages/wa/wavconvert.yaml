description: ! 'This program is useful for turning a directory tree of .wav files

  (presumably created by a CD ripping program) into a tree of .ogg

  files with proper metadata. It is meant to be run on a directory tree

  in which the directory structure is organized according to

  the artist and album names. It runs an .ogg encoder (which is

  assumed to be installed) and sets the metadata in the resulting

  .ogg files based on the directory organization. (See the README

  for examples.) It would be easy to adapt the code to generate

  .mp3 files instead of .ogg, or to use a different encoder

  (currently the "oggenc" program is assumed.)'

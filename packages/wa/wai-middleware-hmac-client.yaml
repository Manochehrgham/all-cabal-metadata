description: ! 'Ready to use client module for

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-middleware-hmac wai-middleware-hmac>.


  Since no formal specification for HMAC authentication exists, this

  module is specifically built for

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-middleware-hmac wai-middleware-hmac>.

  This module is built on @http-client@ but is

  in the @Network.Wai@ namespace since the protocol is mostly specific

  to the middleware.'

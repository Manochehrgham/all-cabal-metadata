synopsis: Wavefront OBJ loader
changelog: ! "### 0.4.0.1\n\n- Fixed a bug in the implementation of `untilEnd`.\n\n#
  0.4\n\n- Removed most modules from the exposed interface. Everything can be found
  in Codec.Wavefront.\n- Changed internal structures of a few types. The structure
  of those types shouldn’t be used in the\n  interface, so a few functions to access
  them was provided.\n\n# 0.3\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- Changed the interface
  to manipulate `WavefrontOBJ`. It’s now a dedicated type with `Vector`\n  instead
  of `DList`, which is way better.\n\n# 0.2\n\n#### Non-breaking changes\n\n- Added
  more verbose documentation everywhere.\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- Removed `ctxtName`.
  It was an old function used to implement user-defined\n  objects, but since we have
  `Element`, we don’t those anymore.\n\n### 0.1.0.2\n\n- Changed the loop of `tokenize`
  from `many1` to `untilEnd` (internal parser in Token.hs). That’s\n  due to the fact
  `many1` silently ignores failures while `untilEnd` does not.\n- Changed implementation
  of `tokenize` to use `choice`, which is implemented exactly as we had.\n- Removed
  `identifier` and use `name` instead to relax conditions on formatting names.\n\n###
  0.1.0.1\n\n- Added forgotten Codec.Wavefront.\n\n# 0.1\n\n- Initial revision.\n"

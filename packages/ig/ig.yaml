description: ! 'This package exports bindings to Instagram''s APIs (see

  <http://instagram.com/developer/>).


  While we would like to have a complete binding to Instagram''s

  API, this package is being developed on demand. If you need

  something that has not been implemented yet, please send a pull

  request or file an issue on GitHub

  (<https://github.com/prowdsponsor/ig/issues>).


  A sample Yesod application demonstrating the API can be found at <https://github.com/prowdsponsor/ig-testapp>.'

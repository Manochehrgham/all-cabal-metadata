description: ! 'Given a possibly-misspelled word,

  this tool spits out one or more properly-spelled words in order

  of likelihood of similarity.


  This functionality is exported as a library via

  Text.SpellingSuggest (suggest) and as

  a command-line program "thimk" (an old joke)


  Running the program "thimk-makedb" is an optional (but highly recommended)

  step to speed up lookups,

  permitting reasonable performance on enormous dictionaries

  by creating a

  precompiled SQlite database of phonetic

  codes for a dictionary.'

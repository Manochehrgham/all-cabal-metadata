description: ! 'A collection of various methods for splitting

  lists into parts, akin to the \"split\" function

  found in several mainstream languages. Here is

  its tale:


  Once upon a time the standard "Data.List" module

  held no function for splitting a list into parts

  according to a delimiter.  Many a brave

  lambda-knight strove to add such a function, but

  their striving was in vain, for Lo, the Supreme

  Council fell to bickering amongst themselves what

  was to be the essential nature of the One True

  Function which could cleave a list in twain (or

  thrain, or any required number of parts).


  And thus came to pass the split package,

  comprising divers functions for splitting a list

  asunder, each according to its nature.  And the

  Supreme Council had no longer any grounds for

  argument, for the favored method of each was

  contained therein.


  To get started, see the "Data.List.Split" module.'

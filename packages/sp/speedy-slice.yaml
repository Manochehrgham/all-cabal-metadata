description: ! 'Speedy slice sampling.


  This implementation of the slice sampling algorithm uses ''lens'' as a means to

  operate over generic indexed traversable functors, so you can expect it to

  work if your target function takes a list, vector, map, sequence, etc. as its

  argument.


  Additionally you can sample over anything that''s an instance of both ''Num'' and

  ''Variate'', which is useful in the case of discrete parameters.


  Exports a ''mcmc'' function that prints a trace to stdout, as well as a

  ''slice'' transition operator that can be used more generally.

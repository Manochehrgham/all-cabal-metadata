synopsis: Convert between ByteString and Vector.Storable without copying

description: ! 'This library allows conversion between the types from @Data.ByteString@

  (package @bytestring@) and @Data.Vector.Storable@ (package @vector@) without

  copying the underlying data.  This is useful, for example, when @ByteString@

  IO produces or consumes vectors of numbers in native byte order.


  This trick relies on the fact that @ByteString@ and @Vector@ use their

  respective @ForeignPtr@s in compatible ways.  It works with

  @bytestring-0.9.1.10@ and @vector-0.9@ on GHC 7.0.  It may break with future

  releases of these packages.  Depending on this library should be seen as a

  way to document and standardize an existing hack, and not as an absolute

  guarantee of correct behavior.'

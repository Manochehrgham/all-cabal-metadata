description: ! 'Pattern matching coverage over Algebraic Data Types(ADTs) has most
  often been studied in the context of pattern compilation algorithms. However, it
  is worth considering the pattern matching coverage problem in isolation, since general
  solutions will be independent of the specifics of any implementation or language.

  We define an intuitive and mathematically well-established bit masking semantics
  for pattern match coverage. We design and implement a sparse bitmap data structure,
  which realizes this semantics in a compact and flexible manner. This bitmap data
  structure supports computing coverage solutions of large programs incrementally
  from coverage solutions of sub-programs. It can also be used as a common data representation
  for pattern coverage shared between different tools (e.g., compilers, linting tools,
  software analysis tools) that need pattern match coverage information.'

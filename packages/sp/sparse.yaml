synopsis: A playground of sparse linear algebra primitives using Morton ordering
changelog: ! '0.9.1

  -----

  * `contravariant 1` support


  0.9

  ---

  * `lens 4` support


  0.7.0.1

  -------

  * Consolidated the tutorial under on "slug" on the FP Complete site, this broke
  all of the URLs in the 0.7 documentation.


  0.7

  ---

  * Switched to using an internal vector type that unboxes as much as it can. This
  lets type inference work much better when playing around at the ghci REPL.


  0.6

  ---

  * Version bumped to exceed the # of Hans Hoglund''s `sparse` package. He started
  and released his library during the creation of this library, but graciously offered
  to let me take over the name. His library is now on hackage as `sparser`.


  0.1

  ---

  * Repository initialized.

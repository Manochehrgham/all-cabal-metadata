description: ! 'This module splits Control.Concurrent.Chan into sending and receiving

  halves, which allows the type system to more finely constrain program

  behavior.   As a secondary benefit,  messages written to channels with

  no receive ports associated with them can be reliably garbage collected.


  In addition, this module incorporates several of clean-ups and additions

  to the venerable Chan.  Most notably,  the deprecated thread-unsafe

  functions have been removed,  the ability to @duplicate@ Receive Ports

  has been added,  the @sendMany@ operation allows for multiple messages

  to be sent atomically,  and the @split@ operation turns a single

  channel into two.'

description: ! 'This is a fairly simple implementation of a

  general-purpose spline library, just to get the code

  out there.  Its interface is still mildly unstable and

  may change (hopefully not drastically) as new needs or

  better style ideas come up.  Patches, suggestions

  and/or feature requests are welcome.'

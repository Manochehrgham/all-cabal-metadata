description: ! 'Splitter lets you specify numerical ranges to split out certain lines

  from a file. This means that you can extract exactly what you want from a file and
  only

  the sections that you want. Or, if you are only interested in a log file after a
  certain

  preamble then you can specify that range of files too.'

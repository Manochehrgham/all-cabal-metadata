description: ! 'Spawn a concurrent ''IO'' computation and later demand its result.  Tiny
  API

  and implementation.


  New in version 0.3:


  * Added functions @parMapIO@, @parMapIO_@, and @(|*|)@, which capture

  common use cases of @spawn@.


  * Updated code to avoid using deprecated functions with @base-4.3@ and

  later (GHC 7.0 and later).  The old code is still used with older

  @base@ libraries.


  * Added public GitHub repository.'

description: ! 'This library provides a type IReal of real numbers and intervals with
  arbitrary precision arithmetic,

  instance declarations for the standard numeric classes, Eq and Ord (the two latter
  non-total for

  computability reasons). Significantly more efficient than other Haskell modules
  for exact

  real arithmetic that we are aware of. Does not depend on non-Haskell libraries.

  A QuickCheck test suite, documentation, and a number of small example

  applications in validated numerics are available at <https://github.com/sydow/ireal.git>.'

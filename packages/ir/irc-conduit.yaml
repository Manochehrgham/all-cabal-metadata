description: ! 'IRC messages consist of an optional identifying prefix, a command

  name, and a list of arguments. The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc irc>

  package provides a low-level decoding and encoding scheme for

  messages in terms of ByteStrings, but using this relies on matching

  names of commands as strings, and unpacking this decoded structure

  yourself. This package takes it a little further, providing an ADT

  for IRC messages and sources, and conduits which attempt to decode

  and encode messages appropriately.


  In addition to providing conduits for automatically handling

  streaming messages, there are also helper functions for connecting

  to an IRC server and hooking up conduits to the socket.'

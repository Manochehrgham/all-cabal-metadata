description: pvd, Photo Viewer Daemon, is an image viewer application that displays
  a fullscreen X11 window and listens for remote commands over TCP. The project also
  includes pvc, a simple command line client application you can use to control pvd.
  pvc has commands for setting the current photo playlist, jumping between photos,
  etc. pvd implements caching in the background which makes it possible to quickly
  switch between photos even if the files are fetched over network or if pvd runs
  on a slow computer. pvd uses the DevIL image library for loading photo files, which
  supports a large number of image formats.

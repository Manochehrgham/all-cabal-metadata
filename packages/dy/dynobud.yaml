description: ! "## dynobud - your dynamic optimization buddy\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ghorn/dynobud.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ghorn/dynobud)\n\nThis
  library has a few distinct features, which may later be broken into separate packages:\n*
  high-level, strongly-typed interface to CasADi\n* NLP modeling/solving (examples/EasyNlp.hs,
  examples/BasicNlp.hs, examples/SofaExpando.hs)\n* OCP modeling/solving (examles/Glider.hs,
  examples/DaeColl.hs)\n* proof of concept monadic NLP/OCP modeling DSL (examples/{NlpDsl.hs,OcpDslRocket.hs})\n*
  live plotter for OCP solving (examples/Dynoplot.hs)\n\nThis package is built on
  top of CasADi (www.casadi.org).\nYou will have to install the CasADi C++ libraries
  and the casadi-bindings haskell package.\nSee http://hackage.haskell.org/package/casadi-bindings
  for instructions.\nInstalling ipopt is also highly recommended if you want to solve
  NLPs (`apt-get install coinor-libipopt-dev` if you're lucky)\n\nPlease keep in mind
  that this library is continually evolving as my PhD progresses and I expect it to
  be very unstable.\nThe API is also very messy as the library is evolving fast and
  it's unclear which parts are internal and external.\nSpecifically, the matrix and
  vector views (J and M) aren't polished enough and don't yet work without leaking
  internals.\nNevertheless, I have started making hackage releases so that my few
  users have some snapshots to version-constrain against.\n\nTo install:\n\n    >>
  cabal update\n    >> cabal install dynobud\n\ncasadi-bindings will probably fail,
  re-read casadi-bindings instructions\n\nTo install dependencies, you may need to
  do something like this:\n\n    >> cabal install alex\n    >> cabal install happy\n
  \   >> cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools\n\n    >> sudo apt-get install coinor-libipopt-dev
  liblapack-dev libblas-dev libglpk-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev
  libzmq3-dev libglib2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgsl0-dev\n\nTo
  build dynobud from source\n\n    >> git clone git://github.com:ghorn/dynobud.git\n
  \   >> cd dynobud\n    >> cabal install --only-dependencies            # without
  examples\n    >> cabal install --only-dependencies -fexamples # with examples\n
  \   >> cabal configure\n    >> cabal build\n\nTry running the examples in dynobud/examples.\n\n
  \   >> cabal configure -fexamples\n    >> cabal build\n    >> dist/build/rocket/rocket\n\nKnown
  issues:\n\n    \"user error: out of memory\"\n\nIf you get this ^ error on OSX while
  using the plotting tools, your\ncairo/pango/gtk may be linked to an XQuartz library.\nAdd
  \"extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/lib\" (or wherever the correct libraries are)\nto your
  .cabal/config and re-install haskell bindings to cairo/pango/gtk/etc\n"

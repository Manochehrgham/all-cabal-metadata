description: ! 'This package uses Template Haskell to generate dynamic linking FFI
  methods from a

  record by using its field names. A load function is generated to create an instance

  of the data from a library path.


  Optional symbols are supported (use Maybe types in the data structure).


  A String->String method can be provided to deal with symbols whose names are not

  exactly the same as field names.


  See <https://github.com/hsyl20/dynamic-linker-template/blob/master/Tests/Test.hs>
  for an example.'

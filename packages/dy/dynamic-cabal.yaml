description: ! 'This library allows you to extract information from cabal files without
  depending on the Cabal library. Since

  GHC currently depends on Cabal, it''s difficult to directly use Cabal if you also
  like to use the GHC API. This package

  solves that problem by using the GHC API itself to interface with Cabal, which means
  that it can use whatever Cabal version

  the user has installed, at run time (the version is not fixed at compile time).
  For a short tutorial, see

  <https://github.com/bennofs/dynamic-cabal>.

  Note: As of GHC 7.10, the ghc library no longer depends on Cabal. So you only need
  this package if you want to support older GHC versions.'

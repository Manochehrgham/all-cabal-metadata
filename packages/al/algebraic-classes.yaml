description: ! 'Algebraic classes are type classes where all the methods return a
  value of the same type, which is also the class parameter.

  Examples from @base@ are @Num@ and @Monoid@.


  F-algebras are functions @f a -> a@, where the functor @f@ is called the signature,
  and the type @a@ the carrier.


  This package relates these 2 concepts, and can create conversions between the two
  using Template Haskell.

  More specifically, it can generate:


  * signatures from algebraic classes


  * instances of algebraic classes from F-algebras.


  This is useful because type classes are more commonly used in Haskell than F-algebras,
  but F-algebras are

  easier to work with, because they are just functions.'

description: ! 'Alms is an experimental, general-purpose programming language that

  supports practical affine types. To offer the expressiveness of

  Girardâ€™s linear logic while keeping the type system light and

  convenient, Alms uses expressive kinds that minimize notation while

  maximizing polymorphism between affine and unlimited types.

  A key feature of Alms is the ability to introduce abstract affine types

  via ML-style signature ascription. In Alms, an interface can impose

  stiffer resource usage restrictions than the principal usage

  restrictions of its implementation. This form of sealing allows the type

  system to naturally and directly express a variety of resource

  management protocols from special-purpose type systems.'

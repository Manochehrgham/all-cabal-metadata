description: ! 'OpenAL is a minimalistic sound API that aims to provide

  bare features for /spacialized audio/. The API looks like

  the OpenGL one, thus the libs are pretty great together.

  Up to now, no OpenAL extension is supported. You''re highly

  invited to contribute ;).

  EAX is not supported yet either. It''ll be embedded in

  future releases, soon.

  IMPORTANT: In order to build and install "al", you''ll

  need to pass the path of the /include/ and /libs/ directory

  of your OpenAL installation if you get errors.

  Then use this to install:

  @ cabal install --extra-include-dirs=path_to_include --extra-lib-dirs=path_to_libs
  @'

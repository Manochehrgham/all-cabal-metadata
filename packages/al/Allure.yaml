  <<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllureOfTheStars/media/master/screenshot/campaign2.png>>


  Please see the changelog file for recent improvements

  and the issue tracker for short-term plans. Long term goals

  are high replayability and auto-balancing through procedural

  content generation and persistent content modification

  based on player behaviour.


  The game is written using the LambdaHack roguelike game engine

  available at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/LambdaHack>.'

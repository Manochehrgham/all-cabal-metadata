synopsis: Near-future Sci-Fi roguelike and tactical squad game
changelog: ! "## [v0.4.101.1, aka 'Officially fun'](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.100.0...v0.4.101.1)\n\n-
  the game is now officially fun to play, with a seal of the Galactic Council\n- introduce
  unique boss monsters and unique artifact items\n- add animals that heal the player,
  in particular as a mid-game reset for HP\n- move spaceship airlock to level 10 and
  beef up spaceship crew\n- let AI gang up, attempt stealth and react to player aggressiveness\n-
  spawn actors fast, close to the enemy and in large numbers\n- spawn actors less
  and less often on a given level, but with growing depth\n- prefer weapons with effects,
  if recharged\n- make the bracing melee bonus additive, not multiplicative\n- let
  explosions buffet actors around\n- make braced actors immune to translocation effects\n-
  make actor domination yet less common and deadly\n- use mouse for movement, actor
  selection, aiming\n- don't run straight with selected actors, but go-to cross-hair
  with them\n- speed up default frame rate, slow down projectiles visually\n- rework
  item manipulation UI\n- you can pick up many items at once and it costs only one
  turn\n- allow actors to apply and project from the shared stash\n- reverse messages
  shown in player diary\n- display actor organs and stats\n- split highscore tables
  wrt game modes\n- move score calculation formula to content\n- don't keep the default/example
  config file commented out; was misleading\n- update vs the naughtily changed v0.5.0.0
  of LambdaHack content API\n\n## [v0.4.100.0, aka 'The last interstellar thaw'](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.99.0...v0.4.100.0)\n\n-
  update vs the unexpectedly thawed v0.5.0.0 of LambdaHack content API\n- unexpectedly
  add items with timeouts and temporary effects\n- start campaign on level 3 and don't
  spawn aliens until level 4\n- rebalance campaign (probably still too hard)\n- tweak
  skills of some factions and actors\n- rename tablets to chips to make their vanishing
  easier to understand\n- make colorful characters bold (if it resizes your fonts,
  turn off via colorIsBold = False in config file or --noColorIsBold on commandline)\n-
  start the game with a screensaver safari mode\n- improve keyboard handling on Windows\n-
  add i386 Linux and Windows compilation targets to Makefile\n\n## [v0.4.99.0, aka
  'Player escapes through airlock'](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.14...v0.4.99.0)\n\n-

  can't be closed\n- assign AI tactics to players, in particular use follow-the-leader
  in safari\n- specify monster spawn rate per-cave\n- generally update content to
  the new v0.5.0.0 of LambdaHack content API\n\n## [v0.4.14, aka 'Out of cosmic balance'](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.12...v0.4.14)\n\n-
  add tons of new (unbalanced) items, actors and descriptions\n- add a simple cabal
  test in addition to make-test and travis-test\n- add items of Wonder and of Marvel\n-
  add game mechanics, items and places to enable stealthy tactics\n- add lots of shrapnel
  (explosions) and organs (body parts)\n- expose a bit of the plot via new game modes
  and their order\n\n## [v0.4.12](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.10...v0.4.12)\n\n-
  make walls lit by default to simplify exploration\n- improve and simplify dungeon

  and generate shrapnel projectiles\n- add game difficulty setting (initial HP scaling
  right now)\n- allow recording, playing back and looping commands\n- implement pathfinding
  via per-actor BFS over the whole level\n- extend setting targets for actors in UI
  tremendously\n- implement autoexplore, go-to-target, etc., as macros\n- let AI use
  pathfinding, switch leaders, pick levels to swarm to\n- force level/leader changes
  on spawners (even when played by humans)\n- extend and redesign UI bottom status
  lines\n\n## [v0.4.10](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.8...v0.4.10)\n\n-

  overhaul and in particular the client-server rewrite\n\n## [v0.4.6.5](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.6...v0.4.6.5)\n\n-
  this is a minor release, primarily intended to fix the broken compilation on Hackage\n-
  changes since 0.4.6 are mostly unrelated to gameplay:\n    - strictly typed config
  files split into UI and rules\n    - a switch from Text to String throughout the
  codebase\n    - use of the external library miniutter for English sentence generation\n\n##
  [v0.4.6](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.4...v0.4.6)\n\n-
  the Main Menu\n- improved and configurable mode of squad combat\n\n## [v0.4.4](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.3...v0.4.4)\n\n-
  missiles flying for three turns (by an old kosmikus' idea)\n- visual feedback for
  targeting\n- animations of combat and individual monster moves\n\n## [v0.4.3](https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/compare/v0.4.2...v0.4.3)\n\n-

description: ! "Allure of the Stars [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AllureOfTheStars/Allure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AllureOfTheStars/Allure)[![Build
  Status](https://drone.io/github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/latest)\n===================\n\n[Allure
  of the Stars] [6] is a near-future Sci-Fi [roguelike] [2]\nand tactical squad game.
  Have a look at [PLAYING.md](GameDefinition/PLAYING.md)\nor jump straight into the
  fray.\n\n![gameplay screenshot](GameDefinition/screenshot.png?raw=true)\n\nThe game
  is written in [Haskell] [1] using the [LambdaHack] [10]\nroguelike game engine.
  Long-term goals of the project are high\nreplayability and auto-balancing through
  procedural content generation\nand persistent content modification based on player
  behaviour.\n\n\nInstallation from binary archives\n---------------------------------\n\nPre-compiled
  game binaries for some platforms are available through\nthe [release page] [11]
  and from the [Nix Packages Collection] [12].\nTo manually install a binary archive,
  make sure you have the GTK\nlibraries suite on your system, unpack the LambdaHack
  archive\nand run the executable in the unpacked directory.\n\nOn Windows, if you
  don't already have GTK installed (e.g., for the GIMP\npicture editor) please download
  and run (with default settings)\nthe GTK installer from\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-win/\n\n\nScreen
  and keyboard configuration\n---------------------------------\n\nThe game UI can
  be configured via a config file.\nA file with the default settings, the same as
  built into the binary, is in\n[GameDefinition/config.ui.default](GameDefinition/config.ui.default).\nWhen
  the game is run for the first time, the file is copied to the official\nlocation,
  which is `~/.Allure/config.ui.ini` on Linux and\n`C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Allure\\config.ui.ini`\n(or
  `C:\\Documents And Settings\\user\\Application Data\\Allure\\config.ui.ini`\nor
  something else altogether) on Windows.\n\nScreen font can be changed and enlarged
  by editing the config file\n at its official location or by CTRL-right-clicking
  on the game window.\n\nIf you use the numeric keypad, use the NumLock key on your
  keyboard\nto toggle the game keyboard mode. With NumLock off, you walk with the
  numeric\nkeys and run with SHIFT (or CONTROL) and the keys. This mode is probably\nthe
  best if you use mouse for running. When you turn NumLock on,\nthe reversed key setup
  enforces good playing habits by setting as the default\nthe run command (which automatically
  stops at threats, keeping you safe)\nand requiring SHIFT (or CONTROL) for the error-prone
  step by step walking.\n\nIf you don't have the numeric keypad, you can use laptop
  keys (uk8o79jl)\nor you can enable the Vi keys (aka roguelike keys) in the config
  file.\n\n\nCompilation from source\n-----------------------\n\nIf you want to compile
  your own binaries from the source code,\nuse Cabal (already a part of your OS distribution,
  or available within\n[The Haskell Platform] [7]), which also takes care of all the
  dependencies.\nYou also need the GTK libraries for your OS. On Linux, remember to
  install\nthe -dev versions as well. On Windows follow [the same steps as for Wine]
  [13].\nOn OSX, if you encounter problems, you may want to\n[compile the GTK libraries
  from sources] [14].\n\nThe latest official version of the game can be downloaded,\ncompiled
  and installed automatically by Cabal from [Hackage] [3] as follows\n\n    cabal
  install gtk2hs-buildtools\n    cabal install Allure --force-reinstalls\n\nFor a
  newer version, install a matching LambdaHack library snapshot\nfrom a development
  branch, download the game source from [github] [5]\nand run `cabal install` from
  the main directory.\n\nCompatibility notes\n-------------------\n\nIf you are using
  a terminal frontend, numeric keypad may not work\ncorrectly depending on versions
  of the libraries, terminfo and terminal\nemulators. The curses frontend is not fully
  supported due to the limitations\nof the curses library. With the vty frontend started
  in an xterm,\nCTRL-keypad keys for running seem to work OK, but on rxvt they do
  not.\nThe commands that require pressing CTRL and SHIFT together won't\nwork either,
  but fortunately they are not crucial to gameplay.\nFor movement, laptop (uk8o79jl)
  and Vi keys (hjklyubn, if enabled\nin config.ui.ini) should work everywhere. GTK
  works fine, too, both\nwith numeric keypad and with mouse.\n\n\nTesting and debugging\n---------------------\n\nThe
  [Makefile](Makefile) contains many sample test commands.\nNumerous tests that use
  the screensaver game modes (AI vs. AI)\nand the dumb `stdout` frontend are gathered
  in `make test`.\nOf these, travis runs `test-travis-*` on each push to the repo.\nTest
  commands with prefix `frontend` start AI vs. AI games\nwith the standard, user-friendly
  gtk frontend.\n\nRun `Allure --help` to see a brief description of all debug options.\nOf
  these, `--sniffIn` and `--sniffOut` are very useful (though verbose\nand initially
  cryptic), for monitoring the traffic between clients\nand the server. Some options
  in the config file may prove useful too,\nthough they mostly overlap with commandline
  options (and will be totally\nmerged at some point).\n\n\nFurther information\n-------------------\n\nFor

description: ! 'A selection of (sequence) alignment algorithms. Both terminal,

  and syntactic variables, as well as the index type is not fixed

  here. This makes it possible to select the correct structure of

  the grammar here, but bind the required data type for alignment

  in user code.


  <https://github.com/choener/AlignmentAlgorithms/blob/master/README.md>


  That being said, these algorithms are mostly aimed towards

  sequence alignment problems.


  * global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch style)

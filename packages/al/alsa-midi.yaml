description: ! 'Bindings for the ALSA sequencer API (MIDI stuff)


  There are now the packages @alsa-pcm@ and @alsa-seq@

  that aim at a more complete interface to ALSA.

  Thus we will no longer maintain this package.


  See "Sound.ALSA.Sequencer.Play" for how to play Haskore songs in realtime via ALSA.'

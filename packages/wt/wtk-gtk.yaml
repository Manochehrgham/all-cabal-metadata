description: ! 'Set of simple tools for standardized development of UI where

  input is set of fields of certain (though various) types

  and there is defined business logic between the fields, values

  they can accept. Helps with error messages for user.

  It''s idea is separation of presentation layer and business logic.

  This succeed but at certain costs.

  Tool is definetely experimental. Contains lots of awkward hacks.'

description: ! 'The @Final@ library makes it possible to point out return values in

  (monadic) functions.  This adds extra compile-time safety to your

  code, because the compiler will warn you if marked return values

  accidentally became middle parts of a big function written with do

  notation.


  Documentation and examples provided in the @Control.Final@ module''s

  own documentation.'

description: ! 'This package allows data types to be seen and manipulated as fixpoints
  of

  their underlying functors. It is mostly based on "Functional Programming with

  Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire" by Erik Meijer, Maarten Fokkinga

  and Ross Paterson (<http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/meijer91functional.html>). It

  makes essential use of associated types and related extensions.'

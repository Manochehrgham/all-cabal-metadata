description: ! 'This library uses elementary techniques to implement fixed point types
  in terms

  of basic integrals such as Word64.  All mathematical operations are implemented

  explicilty, instead of lifting to Integer, so that this code can be used for

  educational purposes or as a basis for fixed point libraries in other languages.'

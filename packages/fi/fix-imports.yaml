description: ! 'There are a few things which can be configured.  Edit src/Main.hs
  and mess with

  the Config it passes in.  There isn''t much configurability but what there is

  should be documented in the modules in which it is defined.


  See the vimrc for an exmaple of how it can be bound to a key in vim.


  It''ll reformat the import lines, including an import list if you have one.

  Sorry about that.  The formatting style of Language.Haskell.Exts.prettyPrint

  is not my personal style.  If it ever bothers me enough maybe I''ll write my

  own formatter, or come up with a way to not reformat unqualified imports.


  Also, it will search for modules starting from ''.'', so you should be in the

  root of the module hierarchy.  It wouldn''t be hard to add a -i flag though.


  haskell-src-exts will crash the program if it gets an ambigious operator

  fixity parse.  I don''t know why it does that, but if you get a crash like that

  you can add your custom operators to the Config.


  It can be a little slow.  Most of this is probably that it rebuilds the

  package index on every run.  So if you have a large package db and it''s too

  slow, caching the package index would probably help.

description: ! 'fix-imports is a small standalone program to manage the import block
  of a

  haskell program.  It will try to add import lines for qualified names

  with no corresponding import, remove unused import lines, and sort the

  import block according to some heuristic you can define.  This only works

  for qualified imports!  Unqualified imports are left untouched.


  It''s most convenient if bound to an editor key.


  Recent major changes:

  * version 1.0.3 and 1.0.4


  * upgrade to haskell-src-exts-1.16


  * version 1.0.2


  * Fix bug where a qualified import with >1 dot wasn''t found.  And don''t

  mess with Prelude.


  * version 1.0.1


  * Fix a bunch of bugs: properly recognize unqualified imports as imports,

  never import the current module, don''t pick up modules with the same suffix

  but a different name.


  * version 1.0.0


  * Change name from FixImports to fix-imports, which is more unixy.


  * Change ghc-pkg parsing from String to Text.  It''s noticeably faster.


  * Add a more flexible system for prioritizing imports.

  When there are several possibilities for a module name, they are all given

  to a single function to decide.  The config file moved from

  fix-imports-priority to .fix-imports and can now specify sort orders for

  packages and modules by prefix.


  * Make -i includes for non-existent dirs ignored instead of causing an

  error.'

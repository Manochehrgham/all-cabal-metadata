description: ! 'Common debugging\/error\/exception functions that give file location
  information


  @

  $(err \"OH NO!\")

  main:Main main.hs:16:1 OH NO!

  @


  Notice how it displays package:module file:line:character


  It exposes the functions err (error), undef (undefined), and trc (Debug.Trace.trace).
  All of these behave the same as their normal counterpart but also spit out a location.


  Here is my favorite helper, debug, which is like trace but just show the value.


  @

  debug [1,2,3]

  DEBUG: [1,2,3]

  [1,2,3]

  @


  And The Template Haskell version.


  @

  $(dbg) [1,2,3]

  DEBUG main:Main main.hs:1:3 [1,2,3]

  [1,2,3]

  @


  Also there is a version of thrwIO that gives location information


  @

  ($(thrwIO) $ AException) `catch` \e -> putStrLn (\"Caught \" ++ show (e :: AException))

  Caught AException \"main:Main test/main.hs:25:6\"

  @

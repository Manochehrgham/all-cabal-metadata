description: ! 'FileSystem allows you to create a virtual file system. This package
  defines:


  * A data structure of a file system, with directories and files.


  * A monad transformer which adds a file system environment, where

  you can do standard system operations, like write and read files

  or create directories.


  * An IO interface for create these virtual file systems from

  existing real directories.'

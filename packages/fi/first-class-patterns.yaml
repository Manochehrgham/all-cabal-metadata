description: ! 'This package implements a library of first class patterns. The

  initial basis for this library was Morten Rhiger''s \"Type-safe

  pattern combinators\"; the patterns can be used in an almost

  identical way to those of Morten Rhiger. In a series of blog

  posts at

  <http://reinerp.wordpress.com/category/pattern-combinators/>

  the types of patterns were made more revealing using type

  families, and a simpler implementation was used which avoids

  some book-keeping.


  The library reimplements most of Haskell''s built-in

  pattern matching facilities, plus some more. The pattern

  matches of this library are lightweight: when GHC''s

  optimisation is turned on, all overhead should be optimised

  away, leaving a standard Haskell pattern match.


  If you''re just reading the documentation for this library for

  the first time, start with "Data.Pattern".'

description: ! 'This packages defines a list data type with statically known length

  by nesting the NonEmpty and Empty data structure from the non-empty package.

  We provide a closed world class for this class of structures

  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Closed_world_instances>

  and a wrapper that makes all these lists @Traversable@

  and @Applicative@ with ZipList semantics.

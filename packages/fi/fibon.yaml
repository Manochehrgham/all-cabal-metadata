description: ! 'Fibon is a set of tools for running and analyzing benchmark programs.

  The fibon package contains the tools for benchmarking, but not the

  benchmarks themselves. The package will build, but will not have any

  benchmarks to run. A set of benchmarks can be found in the github repo


  <http://github.com/dmpots/fibon-benchmarks>


  Fibon is a pure Haskell framework for running and analyzing benchmarks. Cabal

  is used for building the benchmarks, and the benchmark harness, configuration

  files, and benchmark descriptions are all written in Haskell. The benchmark

  descriptions and run configurations are all statically compiled into the

  benchmark runner to ensure that configuration errors are found at compile

  time.


  The Fibon tools are not tied to any compiler infrastructure and can build

  benchmarks using any compiler supported by cabal. However, there are some

  extra features available when using GHC to build the benchmarks:

  * Support in config files for inplace GHC HEAD builds

  * Support in `fibon-run` for collecting GC stats from GHC compiled programs

  * Support in `fibon-analyse` for reading GC stats from Fibon result files

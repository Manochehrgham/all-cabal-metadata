description: ! 'The FIT protocol is used by many sport and fitness devices made by
  companies

  like Garmin, for example running watches and bike computers. `fit` provides an

  API for parsing these files for analysis or conversion.


  Currently this package is a pretty low-level effort, and you''ll need to be familiar

  with FIT to get much value from it. Specifically, the notion of the FIT \"profile\"
  is

  ignored entirely, so to make use of the decoded file you''ll need to reference the

  \"Profile.xls\" spreadsheet in the <http://www.thisisant.com/resources/fit FIT SDK>.


  The "Fit" module exports a convenient set of data types for examining FIT files,
  as

  well as some lenses for extracting specific data. It''s intended that the API in
  the

  "Fit" module should be sufficient and convenient for most uses, but if you need
  access

  to the exact structure of the file you can use the data types in "Fit.Internal.FitFile"

  and parsers in "Fit.Internal.Parse".


  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, suggestions, or requests.'

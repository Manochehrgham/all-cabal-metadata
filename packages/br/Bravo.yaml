description: ! 'Bravo is a text template library that provides parsing and generation
  of templates

  at compile time. Templates can be read from strings or files and for each

  a new record data type is created, allowing convenient access to all template

  variables in a type-safe manner. Since all templates are processed at compile time,

  no extra file access or error handling at runtime is necessary.


  Additional features include the definition of multiple templates per file,

  conditional template evaluation, embedding of Haskell expressions and customized

  data type generation.'

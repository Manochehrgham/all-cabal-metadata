description: ! 'This library can be used as a basis for complex HTML parsers,

  or for streaming.

  E.g., by composing it with

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/list-t-attoparsec the "list-t-attoparsec" library>

  you can produce a token stream,

  thus becoming able to implement a highly efficient stream-parser,

  which works in a single pass, constant memory and is capable of early termination.

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/list-t-html-parser "list-t-html-parser"> is
  such a parser.'

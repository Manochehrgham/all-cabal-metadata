description: Protein Data Bank file format is a most popular format for holding biomolecule
  data. This is a very fast parser (below 7s for the largest entry in PDB - 1HTQ which
  is over 70MB - as compared with 11s of RASMOL 2.7.5, or 2m15s of BioPython with
  Python 2.6 interpreter.) It is aimed to not only deliver event-based interface,
  but also a high-level data structure for manipulating data in spirit of BioPython's
  PDB parser.

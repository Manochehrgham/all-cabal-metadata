description: ! 'This library implements a monad class with various interesting instances:


  * Lazy I/O allows for fetching documents via HTTP on demand


  * Non-I/O allows for testing HTTP communication without any IO action


  By using this monad you can implement HTTP communication in a very general way.

  You may add further functionality by adding custom sub-classes.


  We inherit all content data types from the HTTP-4000 package,

  such as String as well as strict and lazy ByteString.'

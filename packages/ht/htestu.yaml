description: ! 'HTestU is a library for testing correctness of presudo random number
  generators (PRNGs) written in Haskell.

  HTestU uses a library TestU01 based on a paper "TestU01: A C Library for Empirical
  Testing of Random Number Generators" by P. L''Ecuyer and R. Simard.

  Basically HTestU performs a wrapping of a member of the RandomGen typeclass (any
  reasonable PRNG can be made a member of it) and

  feeds a wrapped generator into a C library which calls the wrapped generator to
  fill the buffer with pseudo random numbers and then

  perform tests on the generated numbers.

  HTestU offers three batteries: smallCrush, crush and bigCrush (as they were specified
  in TestU01 paper) and a number of

  streaming functions which allow one to wrap the PRNG differently for the purpose
  of testing different patterns of PRNG usage.'

description: ! 'http-proxy is a library for writing HTTP and HTTPS proxies.


  Use of the Conduit library provides file streaming via the proxy in both

  directions. Memory usage of the proxy scales linearly with the number of

  simultaneous connections and is independent of the size of the files being

  uploaded or downloaded.


  The Settings data type provided by the library allows the caller to supply

  a functions for exception reporting and request re-writing.  Eventually, this

  capability will be expanded to allow optional logging, disk caching etc.'

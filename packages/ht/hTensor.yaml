description: ! 'This is an experimental library for multidimensional arrays,

  oriented to support simple tensor computations and multilinear

  algebra.


  Array dimensions have an \"identity\" which is preserved

  in data manipulation. Indices are explicitly selected by name in

  expressions, and Einstein''s summation convention for repeated indices

  is automatically applied.


  The library has a purely functional interface: arrays are immutable,

  and operations typically work on whole structures which can be assembled

  and decomposed using simple primitives. Arguments are automatically made conformant

  by replicating them along extra dimensions appearing in an operation.

  There is preliminary support for Geometric Algebra and for solving multilinear systems.


  A tutorial can be found in the website of the project.'

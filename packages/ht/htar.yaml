description: ! 'A Command-line utility to create, extract and list the

  contents of tar archives. It can work with compressed

  archives using gzip or bzip2 compression.


  This is in part a demo of the @tar@ library but it is also

  usable in place of the ordinary @tar@ program for systems

  like Windows that do not come with it as standard.'

description: ! 'This package provides a fast and reasonably robust HTML5 tokenizer
  built

  upon the @attoparsec@ library. The parsing strategy is based upon the HTML5

  parsing specification with few deviations.


  The package targets similar use-cases to the venerable @tagsoup@ library,

  but is significantly more efficient, achieving parsing speeds of over 50

  megabytes per second on modern hardware with and typical web documents.'

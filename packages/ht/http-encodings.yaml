description: ! 'A library for encoding and decoding bodies of HTTP messages, designed
  to work with the HTTP and http-server libraries. No heuristic encoding detection
  at this time. WANTED: a library implementing the Unix "compress" command encoding/decoding
  (or the LZW algorithm). The package versions follow Semantic Versioning model (semver.org).'

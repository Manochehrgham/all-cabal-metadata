description: ! 'The library allows to validate and parse an email address

  as it''s defined in <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address
  HTML standard>.

  Note that HTML specification of a valid email address is a

  ''willful violation'' of RFC 5322. If you want to validate

  an address against RFC 5322 you should use <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/email-validate
  email-validate>.'

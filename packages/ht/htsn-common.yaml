description: ! 'This library contains three modules,


  * Network.Services.TSN.Logging


  * Network.Services.TSN.Report


  * Network.Services.TSN.Terminal


  They work together to provide \"reporting\" for the htsn and htsn-import

  executables which both display and log things in the same way.


  The Network.Services.TSN.Logging module allows the application to

  log to syslog, a file, or both. Four convenience functions are

  provided to log messages at each priority: error, debug, info, and

  warn.


  The Network.Services.TSN.Terminal provides similar functions that

  instead display messages on the console (terminal). The output is

  color-coded according to the severity of the message.


  The Network.Services.TSN.Report modules contains convenience

  functions that both log and display informational message. This is

  what an (optionally interactive) application will usually want to

  do.'

description: ! 'Incomplete (no bitvectors) syntax, parser, and inter

  process communication to Yices from Haskell through pipe.

  Purpose for building and using this library was to generate

  test cases from constraints that SMT solvers can solve.  I

  only used it for that particular purpose, so the code in

  general is not yet fully tested.  Use at your own risk and

  error reports are welcomed. See <http://yices.csl.sri.com/>

  for further information on Yices.'

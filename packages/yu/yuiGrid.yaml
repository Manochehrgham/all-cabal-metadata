description: ! 'The grid is specified by boxes, containers and hints telling how these
  boxes and containers should be laid out. The hints also

  include CSS specifications. Everything is rendered to html using Yahoo grids through
  the contextual html combinators

  (see yahoo grids in  <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids >).

  The contextual html combinators are also implemented in this package (called CxML
  here). They allow to keep track of input context

  and output html parts like inline CSSs, JSs, etc.'

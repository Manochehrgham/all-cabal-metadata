description: ! 'A Haskell interface to Lego Mindstorms NXT over Bluetoooth. It supports
  direct commands, messages and

  many sensors (also unofficial). It has also support for a simple message-based control
  of a NXT brick

  via remotely executed program (basic NXC code included).


  It contains three simple programs: @nxt-upload@ for uploading files to a NXT brick,
  @nxt-status@ for displaying

  a NXT brick status, and @nxt-shutdown@ for remote shutdown of a NXT brick.


  It works on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.


  Feel free to contribute additional features, interfaces for more sensors and propose
  or write other

  (example) programs.'

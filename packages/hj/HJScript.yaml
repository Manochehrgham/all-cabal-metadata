description: ! 'HJScript is a DSL built on top of HJavaScript, for writing

  client-side dynamic web pages. The programming model is fairly

  low-level, resembling the actual JavaScript code quite a lot,

  but should be easy to extend with higher-level functionality.

  Notable is that HJScript supports the use of literal XML syntax,

  as defined by the hsx package, for creating DOM ElementNodes.

  Also notable is that HJScript supports Ajax functionality.'

description: ! 'HJavaScript defines an abstract syntax and pretty printer for

  a subset of JavaScript. as Language.HJavaScript. However, a significant

  difference from JavaScript is that HJavaScript is typed, even on the

  abstract syntax level using GADTs. The subset of JavaScript that is

  supported is those parts that lend themself to typing

  (i.e. no prototyping of classes).'

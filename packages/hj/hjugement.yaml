description: ! "# Majority Judgment\n\n## Common language\n\nThe Majority Judgment
  asks us to judge each choice in an absolute way\n(i.e. such that the removal or
  addition of choices\ndoes not change our evaluation of the other choices)\nby giving
  them a grade (or level) on a common scale.\n\nThis common scale contains as many
  grades as our supposed common expertise\nis able to distinguish, in order to faithfully
  represent\nthe properties of the attribute it tries to measure.\nHence, a common
  scale should be crafted for each different attribute.\nThe inter-subjective meaning
  of each grade\nbeing reinforced by the practice of judgments.\n\n### Examples\n\nExamples
  of common scales could be:\n- [“No”, “No, but”, “Yes, but”, “Yes”] for adhesion,\n-
  [“None”, “Not Enough”, “Enough”, “Much”, “Too Much”] for quantity,\n- [“To Do”,
  “Prioritized”, “Blocking”, “Urgent”, “Too Urgent”] for priority,\n- [“Useless”,
  “Interesting”, “Useful”, “Indispensable”, “Enslaving”] for utility,\n- [“To Reject”,
  “Insufficient”, “Acceptable”, “Good”, “Very Good”, “Too Good”] for quality.\n\n##
  Judging one choice\n\nFor each choice taken separately,\nthe initial common scale
  (whose grades are all of equal length 1)\nis dilated such that the length of each
  grade is multiplied\nby the number of individual judgments of this grade obtained
  by this choice.\nLike this, the only level which is defended by an absolute majority\nbegining
  from one side of the scale,\nwithout being rejected by an absolute majority\nbeginning
  from the other side of the scale,\nis the one which spans over the middle of this
  dilated scale.\nThis is the most consensual majority grade for this choice.\n\nIf
  the number of individual judgments is small and even,\nthere is however a probability
  that two different grades\nborder the middle of this dilated scale,\nbut only the
  lower grade rewards consensus,\nand thus is considered to be the most consensual.\nIndeed,
  if any other choice obtains less scattered judgments\nall enclosed to this two grades,\nit
  will obtain a most consensual majoritary grade\ngreater or egal to the one of this
  choice.\nWhich would not necessarily be the case with the greater grade.\n\n## Ranking
  many choices\n\nTo sort many choices means being able to compare them two-by-two,\nwhich
  is done according to their most consensual majority grade.\nIn case of equality,
  the minimum individual judgments of this grade\nare removed from both dilated scales
  so that one of them has no longer any,\nthen the comparison goes on with the new
  most consensual majority grades.\nLike this, either a choice is judged higher than
  the other,\nby the geatest number of judgments which differenciate them according\nto
  a most consensual majoritary grade,\nor both choices precisely have the same distribution
  of individual judgments.\n\nOne can see that the farest an individual judgment is\nfrom
  the most consensual majoritary grade,\nthe less impact it has on the result.\nThis
  rewards honest individual judgments,\nby ignoring as near as may be the most cranky
  or strategic judgements.\n\n## Properties\n\nThe Majority Judgment is:\n\n- allowing
  anonymity:\n  interchanging the names of judges does not change the outcome:\n  all
  judges are given an equal power.\n\n- neutral:\n  interchanging the names of choices
  does not change the outcome:\n  all choices are treated equally.\n\n- complete:\n
  \ every choice is either superior or inferior\n  to any other choice, or both when
  equal.\n  Hence the Majority Judgement is not subject\n  to Condorcet's paradox.\n\n-
  monotone:\n  if a choice is superior or egal to another one,\n  and a judge increases
  its grade for it,\n  it becomes strictly superior.\n\n- transitive:\n  if a first
  choice is superior to a second one,\n  and this second one is superior to a third,\n
  \ then the first is superior to the third).\n\n- coherent:\n  it is independent
  of irrelevant alternatives as formulated by Nash-Chernoff:\n  removal or addition
  of choices does not change\n  the judges’ evaluations of the other choices.\n  Hence
  the Majority Judgement is not subject\n  to Arrow's paradox.\n\n- strategy-proof-in-grading:\n
  \ judging a choice higher or lower\n  than our intimate judgement has the opposite
  impact\n  on its most consensual majority grade.\n\n- partially strategy-proof-in-ranking:\n
  \ increasing (resp. decreasing) the rank of a choice with respect to another choice,\n
  \ can not decrease (resp. increase) the rank of this other choice.\n\n- not Condorcet-consistent
  except when the electorate is “polarized”\n  (when the higher (resp. the lower)
  a judge evaluates one choice the lower (resp. the higher)\n  she/he evaluates the
  other, so there can be no consensus)\n  hence when judges are most tempted to manipulate.\n\n-
  not excluding the no-show paradox (when it is better for a judge not to judge\n
  \ than to express her/his opinion sincerely because her/his vote\n  can tip the
  scales against his favorite choice).\n  \n  This property is judged insignificant,
  by Michel Balinski and Rida Laraki,\n  when compared with the serious problems of
  methods of election,\n  the Arrow and Condorcet paradoxes and strategic manipulation.\n"

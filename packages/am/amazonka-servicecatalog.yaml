  ## Version


  `1.4.4`



  ## Description


  AWS Service Catalog


  __Overview__


  <https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/ AWS Service Catalog> allows organizations
  to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. This
  documentation provides reference material for the AWS Service Catalog end user API.
  To get the most out of this documentation, you need to be familiar with the terminology
  discussed in <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/userguide/what-is_concepts.html
  AWS Service Catalog Concepts>.

  AWS Service Catalog User Guide>


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-servicecatalog)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`

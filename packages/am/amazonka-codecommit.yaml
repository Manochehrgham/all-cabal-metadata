  ## Version


  `1.2.0.1`



  ## Description


  AWS CodeCommit


  This is the /AWS CodeCommit API Reference/. This reference provides

  descriptions of the AWS CodeCommit API.


  You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:


  -   Repositories

  -   Branches

  -   Commits


  For information about how to use AWS CodeCommit, see the /AWS CodeCommit

  User Guide/.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-codecommit)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).


  ## Contribute

  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.

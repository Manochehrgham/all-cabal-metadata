  Description\n\nAWS CodeCommit\n\nThis is the /AWS CodeCommit API Reference/. This
  reference provides\ndescriptions of the operations and data types for AWS CodeCommit
  API.\n\nYou can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:\n\n-
  \  Repositories, by calling the following:\n    -   < BatchGetRepositories>, which
  returns information about one or\n        more repositories associated with your
  AWS account\n    -   < CreateRepository>, which creates an AWS CodeCommit repository\n
  \   -   < DeleteRepository>, which deletes an AWS CodeCommit repository\n    -   <
  GetRepository>, which returns information about a specified\n        repository\n
  \   -   < ListRepositories>, which lists all AWS CodeCommit repositories\n        associated
  with your AWS account\n    -   < UpdateRepositoryDescription>, which sets or updates
  the\n        description of the repository\n    -   < UpdateRepositoryName>, which
  changes the name of the\n        repository. If you change the name of a repository,
  no other\n        users of that repository will be able to access it until you\n
  \       send them the new HTTPS or SSH URL to use.\n-   Branches, by calling the
  following:\n    -   < CreateBranch>, which creates a new branch in a specified\n
  \       repository\n    -   < GetBranch>, which returns information about a specified
  branch\n    -   < ListBranches>, which lists all branches for a specified\n        repository\n
  \   -   < UpdateDefaultBranch>, which changes the default branch for a\n        repository\n-
  \  Information about committed code in a repository, by calling the\n    following:\n
  \   -   < GetCommit>, which returns information about a commit,\n        including
  commit messages and committer information.\n-   Triggers, by calling the following:\n
  \   -   < GetRepositoryTriggers>, which returns information about\n        triggers
  configured for a repository\n    -   < PutRepositoryTriggers>, which replaces all
  triggers for a\n        repository and can be used to create or delete triggers\n
  \   -   < TestRepositoryTriggers>, which tests the functionality of a\n        repository
  trigger by sending data to the trigger target\n\nFor information about how to use
  AWS CodeCommit, see the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html
  AWS CodeCommit User Guide>.\n\nDocumentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-codecommit)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from
  this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-codecommit` is released under

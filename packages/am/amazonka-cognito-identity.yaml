  ## Description


  Amazon Cognito is a web service that facilitates the delivery of scoped,

  temporary credentials to mobile devices or other untrusted environments.

  Amazon Cognito uniquely identifies a device or user and supplies the user

  with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application. Amazon

  Cognito lets users authenticate with third-party identity providers

  (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon). As a developer, you decide which

  identity providers to trust. You can also choose to support unauthenticated

  access from your application. Your users are provided with Cognito tokens

  that uniquely identify their device and any information provided about

  third-party logins.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cognito-identity)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

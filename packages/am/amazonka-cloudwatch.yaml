description: ! 'Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources
  and the

  applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and

  track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. Amazon

  CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon

  DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well as custom metrics

  generated by your applications and services, and any log files your

  applications generate. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide

  visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and

  operational health. You can use these insights to react and keep your

  application running smoothly.

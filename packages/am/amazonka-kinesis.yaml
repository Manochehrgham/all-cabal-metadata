description: ! 'Amazon Kinesis is a managed service that scales elastically for real-time

  processing of streaming big data. The service takes in large streams of data

  records that can then be consumed in real time by multiple data-processing

  applications that can be run on Amazon EC2 instances.


  /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS
  API Reference>


  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

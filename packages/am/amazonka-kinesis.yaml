  ## Description


  Amazon Kinesis is a managed service that scales elastically for real-time

  processing of streaming big data. The service takes in large streams of data

  records that can then be consumed in real time by multiple data-processing

  applications that can be run on Amazon EC2 instances.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-kinesis)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

  ## Description


  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control

  access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can

  create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny

  their access to AWS resources.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-iam)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

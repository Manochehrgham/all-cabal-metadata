  Version\n\n`1.4.4`\n\n\n## Description\n\nApplication Auto Scaling is a general
  purpose Auto Scaling service for supported elastic AWS resources. With Application
  Auto Scaling, you can automatically scale your AWS resources, with an experience
  similar to that of Auto Scaling.\n\nApplication Auto Scaling supports scaling the
  following AWS resources:\n\n-   Amazon ECS services\n\n-   Amazon EC2 Spot fleet
  instances\n\nYou can use Application Auto Scaling to accomplish the following tasks:\n\n-
  \  Define scaling policies for automatically adjusting your AWS resources\n\n-   Scale
  your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms\n\n-   View history of your scaling
  events\n\nApplication Auto Scaling is available in the following regions:\n\n-   \n
  \   @\n    us-east-1\n    @\n    \n\n-   \n    @\n    us-west-1\n    @\n    \n\n-
  \  \n    @\n    us-west-2\n    @\n    \n\n-   \n    @\n    ap-southeast-1\n    @\n
  \   \n\n-   \n    @\n    ap-southeast-2\n    @\n    \n\n-   \n    @\n    ap-northeast-1\n
  \   @\n    \n\n-   \n    @\n    eu-central-1\n    @\n    \n\n-   \n    @\n    eu-west-1\n
  \   @\n    \n\nDocumentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-application-autoscaling)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from
  this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-application-autoscaling` is released

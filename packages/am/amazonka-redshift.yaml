  ## Description


  Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse

  service that makes it simple and cost-effective to efficiently analyze all

  your data using your existing business intelligence tools. You can start

  small for just $0.25 per hour with no commitments or upfront costs and scale

  to a petabyte or more for $1,000 per terabyte per year, less than a tenth of

  most other data warehousing solutions.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-redshift)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

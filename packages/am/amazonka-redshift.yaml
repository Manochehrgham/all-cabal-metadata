description: ! 'Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse

  service that makes it simple and cost-effective to efficiently analyze all

  your data using your existing business intelligence tools. You can start

  small for just $0.25 per hour with no commitments or upfront costs and scale

  to a petabyte or more for $1,000 per terabyte per year, less than a tenth of

  most other data warehousing solutions.


  /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html AWS
  API Reference>


  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

  ## Version


  `1.0.1`



  ## Description


  Definition of the public APIs exposed by Amazon Machine Learning


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ml)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

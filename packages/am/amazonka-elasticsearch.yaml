  ## Version


  `1.4.1`



  ## Description


  Amazon Elasticsearch Configuration Service


  Use the Amazon Elasticsearch configuration API to create, configure, and

  manage Elasticsearch domains.


  The endpoint for configuration service requests is region-specific:

  es./region/.amazonaws.com. For example, es.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. For

  a current list of supported regions and endpoints, see

  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cloudsearch_region Regions
  and Endpoints>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elasticsearch)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

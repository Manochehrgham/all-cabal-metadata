  ## Description


  The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to

  request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access

  Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users).


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sts)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

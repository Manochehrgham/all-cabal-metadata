  ## Version


  `1.4.3`



  ## Description


  Amazon Glacier is a storage solution for \"cold data.\"


  Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides secure, durable,
  and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival. With Amazon Glacier, customers
  can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or decades. Amazon Glacier
  also enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling
  storage to AWS, so they don\''t have to worry about capacity planning, hardware
  provisioning, data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or time-consuming
  hardware migrations.


  Amazon Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is paramount, your
  data is rarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of several hours is acceptable.
  If your application requires fast or frequent access to your data, consider using
  Amazon S3. For more information, go to <http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ Amazon Simple
  Storage Service (Amazon S3)>.


  You can store any kind of data in any format. There is no maximum limit on the total
  amount of data you can store in Amazon Glacier.


  If you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you begin by reading
  the following sections in the /Amazon Glacier Developer Guide/:


  -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html What
  is Amazon Glacier> - This section of the Developer Guide describes the underlying
  data model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact
  with the service.


  -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html
  Getting Started with Amazon Glacier> - The Getting Started section walks you through
  the process of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives,
  retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-glacier)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  ## Description


  Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost storage service

  for data archiving and online backup. Customers can reliably store large or

  small amounts of data for as little as $0.01 per gigabyte per month, a

  significant savings compared to on-premises solutions. To keep costs low,

  Amazon Glacier is optimized for infrequently accessed data where a retrieval

  time of several hours is suitable.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-glacier)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html).

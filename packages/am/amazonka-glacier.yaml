  Description\n\nAmazon Glacier is a storage solution for \\\"cold data.\\\"\n\nAmazon
  Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides\nsecure, durable,
  and easy-to-use storage for data backup and archival.\nWith Amazon Glacier, customers
  can store their data cost effectively for\nmonths, years, or decades. Amazon Glacier
  also enables customers to\noffload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling
  storage to\nAWS, so they don\\'t have to worry about capacity planning, hardware\nprovisioning,
  data replication, hardware failure and recovery, or\ntime-consuming hardware migrations.\n\nAmazon
  Glacier is a great storage choice when low storage cost is\nparamount, your data
  is rarely retrieved, and retrieval latency of\nseveral hours is acceptable. If your
  application requires fast or\nfrequent access to your data, consider using Amazon
  S3. For more\ninformation, go to\n<http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ Amazon Simple Storage
  Service (Amazon S3)>.\n\nYou can store any kind of data in any format. There is
  no maximum limit\non the total amount of data you can store in Amazon Glacier.\n\nIf
  you are a first-time user of Amazon Glacier, we recommend that you\nbegin by reading
  the following sections in the /Amazon Glacier Developer\nGuide/:\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html
  What is Amazon Glacier>\n    - This section of the Developer Guide describes the
  underlying data\n    model, the operations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you
  can use\n    to interact with the service.\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/amazon-glacier-getting-started.html
  Getting Started with Amazon Glacier>\n    - The Getting Started section walks you
  through the process of\n    creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs
  to download\n    archives, retrieving the job output, and deleting archives.\n\nDocumentation
  is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-glacier)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from
  this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-glacier` is released under the
  [Mozilla Public License Version 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/).\n\nParts of the

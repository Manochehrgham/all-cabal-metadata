description: ! 'Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost storage
  service

  for data archiving and online backup. Customers can reliably store large or

  small amounts of data for as little as $0.01 per gigabyte per month, a

  significant savings compared to on-premises solutions. To keep costs low,

  Amazon Glacier is optimized for infrequently accessed data where a retrieval

  time of several hours is suitable.

  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

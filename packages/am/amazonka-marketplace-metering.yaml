  ## Version


  `1.4.1`



  ## Description


  AWS Marketplace Metering Service


  This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace

  Metering Service API.


  AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom

  usage dimensions.


  __Submitting Metering Records__


  -   /MeterUsage/- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-marketplace-metering)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  ## Description


  AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that you can use to automate the movement

  and transformation of data. With AWS Data Pipeline, you can define

  data-driven workflows, so that tasks can be dependent on the successful

  completion of previous tasks.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-datapipeline)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

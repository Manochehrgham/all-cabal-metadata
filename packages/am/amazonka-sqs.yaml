description: ! 'Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully

  managed message queuing service. SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to

  decouple the components of a cloud application. You can use SQS to transmit

  any volume of data, at any level of throughput, without losing messages or

  requiring other services to be always available. With SQS, you can offload

  the administrative burden of operating and scaling a highly available

  messaging cluster, while paying a low price for only what you use.


  /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html
  AWS API Reference>


  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

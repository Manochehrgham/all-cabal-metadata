  ## Version


  `1.4.3`



  ## Description


  Welcome to the /Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference/. This section describes
  who should read this guide, how the guide is organized, and other resources related
  to the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).


  Amazon SQS offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing messages as they
  travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, you can move data between distributed
  components of your applications that perform different tasks without losing messages
  or requiring each component to be always available.

  We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SQS from your preferred programming
  language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks
  such as:


  -   Cryptographically signing your service requests

  -   Retrying requests

  -   Handling error responses


  For a list of available SDKs, go to <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon
  Web Services>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sqs)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

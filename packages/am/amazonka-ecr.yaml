  ## Version


  `1.4.1`



  ## Description


  Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed AWS Docker

  registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI to push,

  pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and

  reliable registry. Amazon ECR supports private Docker repositories with

  resource-based permissions using AWS IAM so that specific users or

  Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images. Developers can

  use the Docker CLI to author and manage images.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ecr)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

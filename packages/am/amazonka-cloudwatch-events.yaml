  ## Version


  `1.4.4`



  ## Description


  Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources.
  When your resources change state they automatically send events into an event stream.
  You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to
  targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a pre-determined
  schedule. For example, you can configure rules to:


  -   Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event
  notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.

  -   Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis stream for
  detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.

  -   Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS
  volume.


  For more information about Amazon CloudWatch Events features, see the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide
  Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudwatch-events)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

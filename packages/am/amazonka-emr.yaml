  ## Description


  Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) is a web service that makes it easy to

  process large amounts of data efficiently. Amazon EMR uses Hadoop processing

  combined with several AWS products to do such tasks as web indexing, data

  mining, log file analysis, machine learning, scientific simulation, and data

  warehousing.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-emr)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/API/Welcome.html).

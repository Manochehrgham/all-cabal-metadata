  It

  provides secure and reliable routing to your infrastructure that uses Amazon

  Web Services (AWS) products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon

  EC2), Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

  You can also use Amazon Route 53 to route users to your infrastructure

  outside of AWS.

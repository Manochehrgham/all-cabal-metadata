  ## Description


  Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static

  and dynamic web content, for example, .html, .css, .php, image, and media

  files, to end users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide

  network of edge locations. When an end user requests content that you''re

  serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that

  provides the lowest latency, so content is delivered with the best possible

  performance. If the content is already in that edge location, CloudFront

  delivers it immediately. If the content is not currently in that edge

  location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon S3 bucket or an HTTP server

  (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the

  definitive version of your content.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudfront)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

  ## Version


  `1.0.1`



  ## Description


  Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your

  static and dynamic web content, for example, .html, .css, .php, image,

  and media files, to end users. CloudFront delivers your content through

  a worldwide network of edge locations. When an end user requests content

  that you\''re serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge

  location that provides the lowest latency, so content is delivered with

  the best possible performance. If the content is already in that edge

  location, CloudFront delivers it immediately. If the content is not

  currently in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon

  S3 bucket or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have

  identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudfront)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  ## Version


  `1.4.3`



  ## Description


  Amazon DynamoDB Streams


  This is the Amazon DynamoDB Streams API Reference. This guide describes the low-level
  API actions for accessing streams and processing stream records. For information
  about application development with DynamoDB Streams, see the <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide//Streams.html
  Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide>.


  Note that this document is intended for use with the following DynamoDB documentation:


  -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ Amazon DynamoDB
  Developer Guide>


  -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/ Amazon DynamoDB
  API Reference>


  The following are short descriptions of each low-level DynamoDB Streams API action,
  organized by function.


  -   /DescribeStream/ - Returns detailed information about a particular stream.


  -   /GetRecords/ - Retrieves the stream records from within a shard.


  -   /GetShardIterator/ - Returns information on how to retrieve the streams record
  from a shard with a given shard ID.


  -   /ListStreams/ - Returns a list of all the streams associated with the current
  AWS account and endpoint.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-dynamodb-streams)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

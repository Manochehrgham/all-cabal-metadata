description: ! 'Auto Scaling allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down

  automatically according to conditions you define. With Auto Scaling, you can

  ensure that the number of Amazon EC2 instances youâ€™re using increases

  seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance, and decreases

  automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs. Auto Scaling is

  particularly well suited for applications that experience hourly, daily, or

  weekly variability in usage. Auto Scaling is enabled by Amazon CloudWatch and

  available at no additional charge beyond Amazon CloudWatch fees.

  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

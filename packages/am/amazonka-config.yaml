  ## Description


  Amazon Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an Amazon

  resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change

  notifications to enable security and governance. With Amazon Config you can

  discover existing Amazon resources, export a complete inventory of your

  Amazon resources with all configuration details, and determine how a resource

  was configured at any point in time. These capabilities enable compliance

  auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-config)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

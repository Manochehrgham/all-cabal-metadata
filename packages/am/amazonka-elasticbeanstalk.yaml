description: ! 'AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and
  scaling web

  applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python,

  Ruby, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache HTTP Server, Apache

  Tomcat, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS 7.5/8. You can simply upload your code and

  Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity

  provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.

  At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering

  your application and can access the underlying resources at any time. There

  is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS

  resources needed to store and run your applications.


  /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/api/Welcome.html AWS
  API Reference>


  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

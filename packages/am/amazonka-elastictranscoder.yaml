  ## Description


  Amazon Elastic Transcoder lets you convert media files that you have stored

  in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) into media files in the formats

  required by consumer playback devices. For example, you can convert large,

  high-quality digital media files into formats that users can play back on

  mobile devices, tablets, web browsers, and connected televisions.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-elastictranscoder)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/latest/developerguide/api-reference.html).

description: ! 'AWS Import/Export accelerates moving large amounts of data into and
  out of

  AWS using portable storage devices for transport. AWS transfers your data

  directly onto and off of storage devices using Amazonâ€™s high-speed internal

  network and bypassing the Internet. For significant data sets, AWS

  Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective

  than upgrading your connectivity.

  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

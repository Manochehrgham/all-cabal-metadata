  ## Description


  AWS Import/Export accelerates moving large amounts of data into and out of

  AWS using portable storage devices for transport. AWS transfers your data

  directly onto and off of storage devices using Amazonâ€™s high-speed internal

  network and bypassing the Internet. For significant data sets, AWS

  Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective

  than upgrading your connectivity.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-importexport)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/DG/api-reference.html).

  Description\n\nAWS CodeDeploy __Overview__\n\nThis is the AWS CodeDeploy API Reference.
  This guide provides\ndescriptions of the AWS CodeDeploy APIs. For additional information,
  see\nthe\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide AWS CodeDeploy
  User Guide>.\n\n__Using the APIs__\n\nYou can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to work
  with the following items:\n\n-   Applications are unique identifiers that AWS CodeDeploy
  uses to\n    ensure that the correct combinations of revisions, deployment\n    configurations,
  and deployment groups are being referenced during\n    deployments.\n\n    You can
  use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, list,\n    and update applications.\n\n-
  \  Deployment configurations are sets of deployment rules and\n    deployment success
  and failure conditions that AWS CodeDeploy uses\n    during deployments.\n\n    You
  can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, delete, get, and list\n    deployment
  configurations.\n\n-   Deployment groups are groups of instances to which application\n
  \   revisions can be deployed.\n\n    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create,
  delete, get, list,\n    and update deployment groups.\n\n-   Instances represent
  Amazon EC2 instances to which application\n    revisions are deployed. Instances
  are identified by their Amazon EC2\n    tags or Auto Scaling group names. Instances
  belong to deployment\n    groups.\n\n    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to
  get and list instances.\n\n-   Deployments represent the process of deploying revisions
  to\n    instances.\n\n    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to create, get, list,
  and stop\n    deployments.\n\n-   Application revisions are archive files that are
  stored in Amazon S3\n    buckets or GitHub repositories. These revisions contain
  source\n    content (such as source code, web pages, executable files, any\n    deployment
  scripts, and similar) along with an Application\n    Specification file (AppSpec
  file). (The AppSpec file is unique to\n    AWS CodeDeploy; it defines a series of
  deployment actions that you\n    want AWS CodeDeploy to execute.) An application
  revision is uniquely\n    identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version,
  or\n    both (for application revisions that are stored in Amazon S3\n    buckets)
  or by its repository name and commit ID (for applications\n    revisions that are
  stored in GitHub repositories). Application\n    revisions are deployed through
  deployment groups.\n\n    You can use the AWS CodeDeploy APIs to get, list, and
  register\n    application revisions.\n\nDocumentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-codedeploy)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).\n\nThe
  types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-codedeploy` is released under

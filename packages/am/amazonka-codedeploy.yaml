  ## Description


  Amazon CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployments to Amazon EC2

  instances. Amazon CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new

  features, helps you avoid downtime during deployment, and handles the

  complexity of updating your applications. You can use Amazon CodeDeploy to

  automate deployments, eliminating the need for error-prone manual operations,

  and the service scales with your infrastructure so you can easily deploy to

  one EC2 instance or thousands.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-codedeploy)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

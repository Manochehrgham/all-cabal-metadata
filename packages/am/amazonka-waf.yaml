  ## Version


  `1.3.7`



  ## Description


  This is the /AWS WAF API Reference/. This guide is for developers who

  need detailed information about the AWS WAF API actions, data types, and

  errors. For detailed information about AWS WAF features and an overview

  of how to use the AWS WAF API, see the

  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/dev/ AWS WAF Developer Guide>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-waf)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  ## Version


  `1.4.4`



  ## Description


  Amazon Kinesis Analytics is the easiest way to process streaming data in real time
  with standard SQL without having to learn new programming languages or processing
  frameworks. Amazon Kinesis Analytics enables you to create and run SQL queries on
  streaming data so that you can gain actionable insights and respond to your business
  and customer needs promptly. Amazon Kinesis Analytics takes care of everything required
  to run your queries continuously and scales automatically to match the volume and
  throughput rate of your incoming data. With Amazon Kinesis Analytics, you only pay
  for the resources your queries consume. There is no minimum fee or setup cost.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-kinesis-analytics)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

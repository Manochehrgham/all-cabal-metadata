  ## Description


  Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy

  for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data,

  and uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of your

  keys. Amazon Key Management Service is integrated with other Amazon services

  including Amazon EBS, Amazon S3, and Amazon Redshift. Amazon Key Management

  Service is also integrated with Amazon CloudTrail to provide you with logs of

  all key usage to help meet your regulatory and compliance needs.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-kms)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

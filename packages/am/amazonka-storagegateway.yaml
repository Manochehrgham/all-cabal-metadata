  ## Version


  `1.4.3`



  ## Description


  AWS Storage Gateway Service


  AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software appliance
  with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organization\''s
  on-premises IT environment and AWS\''s storage infrastructure. The service enables
  you to securely upload data to the AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid
  disaster recovery.


  Use the following links to get started using the /AWS Storage Gateway Service API
  Reference/:


  -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders.html
  AWS Storage Gateway Required Request Headers>: Describes the required headers that
  you must send with every POST request to AWS Storage Gateway.

  -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests.html
  Signing Requests>: AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request
  you send; this topic describes how sign such a request.

  -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/APIErrorResponses.html
  Error Responses>: Provides reference information about AWS Storage Gateway errors.

  -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPIOperations.html
  Operations in AWS Storage Gateway>: Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS Storage
  Gateway operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible errors,
  and examples of requests and responses.

  -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html AWS Storage
  Gateway Regions and Endpoints>: Provides a list of each of the s and endpoints available
  for use with AWS Storage Gateway.


  AWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs
  with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change
  your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage
  Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-1122AABB. When you use this ID with the
  EC2 API, you must change it to vol-1122aabb. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave
  as expected.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-storagegateway)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  [Contribute](#contribute)\n* [Licence](#licence)\n\n\n## Version\n\n`1.4.4`\n\n\n##
  Description\n\nAWS Storage Gateway Service\n\nAWS Storage Gateway is the service
  that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide
  seamless and secure integration between an organization\\'s on-premises IT environment
  and AWS\\'s storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data
  to the AWS cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.\n\nUse the
  following links to get started using the /AWS Storage Gateway Service API Reference/:\n\n-
  \  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders.html
  AWS Storage Gateway Required Request Headers>: Describes the required headers that
  you must send with every POST request to AWS Storage Gateway.\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests.html
  Signing Requests>: AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request
  you send; this topic describes how sign such a request.\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/APIErrorResponses.html
  Error Responses>: Provides reference information about AWS Storage Gateway errors.\n\n-
  \  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPIOperations.html
  Operations in AWS Storage Gateway>: Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS Storage
  Gateway operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible errors,
  and examples of requests and responses.\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html
  AWS Storage Gateway Regions and Endpoints>: Provides a list of each of the s and
  endpoints available for use with AWS Storage Gateway.\n\nAWS Storage Gateway resource
  IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2
  expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase
  to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume
  might be \n    @\n    vol-1122AABB\n    @\n    . When you use this ID with the EC2
  API, you must change it to \n    @\n    vol-1122aabb\n    @\n    . Otherwise, the
  EC2 API might not behave as expected.\n\nIDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon
  EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting
  in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character
  string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you
  can test your systems with the new format. For more information, see <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids
  Longer EC2 and EBS Resource IDs>.\n\nFor example, a volume ARN with the longer volume
  ID format will look like this:\n\n\n    @\n    arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway\\/sgw-12A3456B\\/volume\\/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG\n
  \   @\n    .\n\nA snapshot ID with the longer ID format will look like this: \n
  \   @\n    snap-78e226633445566ee\n    @\n    .\n\nFor more information, see <https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=3557
  Announcement: Heads-up â€“ Longer AWS Storage Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming
  in 2016>.\n\nDocumentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-storagegateway)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from
  this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-storagegateway` is released under

  ## Version


  `1.3.5`



  ## Description


  AWS IoT (Beta)


  __AWS IoT is in beta and is subject to change__


  AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between

  Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices,

  or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. You can discover your custom

  IoT-Data endpoint to communicate with, configure rules for data

  processing and integration with other services, organize resources

  associated with each thing (Thing Registry), configure logging, and

  create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate things.


  For more information about how AWS IoT works, see the

  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html
  Developer Guide>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-iot)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/iot).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

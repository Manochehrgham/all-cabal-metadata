  ## Version


  `1.1.0`



  ## Description


  Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions

  of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and

  effort associated with building and operating a web-scale database,

  SimpleDB provides developers the freedom to focus on application

  development.


  A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront

  capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and

  repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically

  simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and

  providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates

  the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and

  performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality within

  Amazon\''s proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and

  pay only for what they use.


  Visit <http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/> for more information.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sdb)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/SDB_API.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

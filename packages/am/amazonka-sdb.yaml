  ## Description


  Amazon SimpleDB is a highly available and flexible non-relational data store

  that offloads the work of database administration. Developers simply store

  and query data items via web services requests and Amazon SimpleDB does the

  rest. Unbound by the strict requirements of a relational database, Amazon

  SimpleDB is optimized to provide high availability and flexibility, with

  little or no administrative burden. Behind the scenes, Amazon SimpleDB

  creates and manages multiple geographically distributed replicas of your data

  automatically to enable high availability and data durability. The service

  charges you only for the resources actually consumed in storing your data and

  serving your requests. You can change your data model on the fly, and data is

  automatically indexed for you. With Amazon SimpleDB, you can focus on

  application development without worrying about infrastructure provisioning,

  high availability, software maintenance, schema and index management, or

  performance tuning.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-sdb)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/SDB_API.html).

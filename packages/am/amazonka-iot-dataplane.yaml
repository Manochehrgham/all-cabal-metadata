  ## Version


  `1.3.5`



  ## Description


  AWS IoT (Beta)


  __AWS IoT is considered a beta service as defined in the Service Terms__


  AWS IoT-Data enables secure, bi-directional communication between

  Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices,

  or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. It implements a broker for

  applications and things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish) and

  retrieve, update, and delete thing shadows. A thing shadow is a

  persistent representation of your things and their state in the AWS

  cloud.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-iot-dataplane)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/iot).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

description: ! 'ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate,
  and scale

  an in-memory cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web

  applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed,

  in-memory caches, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.

  Amazon ElastiCache automatically detects and replaces failed nodes, reducing

  the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures and provides a

  resilient system that mitigates the risk of overloaded databases, which slow

  website and application load times. Through integration with Amazon

  CloudWatch, Amazon ElastiCache provides enhanced visibility into key

  performance metrics associated with your Memcached or Redis nodes.

  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

  ## Version


  `1.3.7`



  ## Description


  Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast,

  container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage

  Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances. Amazon ECS lets you

  launch and stop container-enabled applications with simple API calls,

  allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service,

  and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features like security

  groups, Amazon EBS volumes, and IAM roles.


  You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across

  your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and

  availability requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the

  need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration

  management systems or worry about scaling your management

  infrastructure.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ecs)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

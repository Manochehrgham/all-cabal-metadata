  ## Description


  Amazon EC2 Container Service is a highly scalable, high performance container

  management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily

  run distributed applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

  Amazon EC2 Container Service lets you launch and stop container-enabled

  applications with simple API calls, allows you to query the state of your

  cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar

  Amazon EC2 features like security groups, EBS volumes and IAM roles. You can

  use EC2 Container Service to schedule the placement of containers across your

  cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability

  requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to

  operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or

  worry about scaling your management infrastructure.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ecs)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

description: ! 'CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS
  account

  and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information

  includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the

  source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned

  by the service.


  /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html

  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

  ## Description


  CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account

  and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information

  includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the

  source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned

  by the service.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudtrail)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

description: ! 'AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to
  events and

  automatically manages the compute resources for you, making it easy to build

  applications that respond quickly to new information. AWS Lambda starts

  running your code within milliseconds of an event such as an image upload,

  in-app activity, website click, or output from a connected device. You can

  also use AWS Lambda to create new back-end services where compute resources

  are automatically triggered based on custom requests. With AWS Lambda you pay

  only for the requests served and the compute time required to run your code.

  Billing is metered in increments of 100 milliseconds, making it

  cost-effective and easy to scale automatically from a few requests per day to

  thousands per second.


  /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Reference.html AWS API Reference>


  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

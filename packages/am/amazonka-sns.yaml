description: ! 'Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fast, flexible,
  fully

  managed push messaging service. Amazon SNS makes it simple and cost-effective

  to push notifications to Apple, Google, Fire OS, and Windows devices, as well

  as Android devices in China with Baidu Cloud Push. You can also use SNS to

  push notifications to internet connected smart devices, as well as other

  distributed services. Besides pushing cloud notifications directly to mobile

  devices, Amazon SNS can also deliver notifications by SMS text message or

  email, to Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues, or to any HTTP endpoint.

  To prevent messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are

  stored redundantly across multiple availability zones.


  /See:/ <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>


  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

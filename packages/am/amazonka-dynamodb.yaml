  ## Description


  Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast

  and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Amazon

  DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of

  data, and serve any level of request traffic. Amazon DynamoDB automatically

  spreads the data and traffic for the table over a sufficient number of

  servers to handle the request capacity specified by the customer and the

  amount of data stored, while maintaining consistent and fast performance.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-dynamodb)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

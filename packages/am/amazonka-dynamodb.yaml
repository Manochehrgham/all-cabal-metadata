description: ! 'Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides
  fast

  and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Amazon

  DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of

  data, and serve any level of request traffic. Amazon DynamoDB automatically

  spreads the data and traffic for the table over a sufficient number of

  servers to handle the request capacity specified by the customer and the

  amount of data stored, while maintaining consistent and fast performance.

  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

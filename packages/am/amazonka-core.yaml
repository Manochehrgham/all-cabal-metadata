description: ! 'Core functionality, serialisation primitives, and data types for

  Amazonka related Amazon Web Services SDKs.


  The external interface of this library is stable with respect to the

  downstream Amazonka libraries, only, and as such is probably not suitable

  for use in non-Amazonka projects.


  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

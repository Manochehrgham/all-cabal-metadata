description: ! 'Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build

  applications that coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon

  SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a

  component of your application. Coordinating tasks across the application

  involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in

  accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you

  full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying

  about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining

  their state.

  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

  ## Description


  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes

  it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It

  provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming

  database administration tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications

  and business.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-rds)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

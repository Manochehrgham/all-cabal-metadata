  ## Version


  `1.3.4`



  ## Description


  Amazon Relational Database Service


  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that

  makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in

  the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an

  industry-standard relational database and manages common database

  administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their

  applications and businesses unique.


  Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, PostgreSQL,

  Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Aurora database server. This means the

  code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing

  databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS

  automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software

  that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your

  database instance\''s compute resources and storage capacity to meet your

  application\''s demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no

  up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.


  This is an interface reference for Amazon RDS. It contains documentation

  for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon

  RDS. Note that Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some

  interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback

  functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this

  reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is

  applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the

  maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, go to

  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html#Welcome.Interfaces
  Available RDS Interfaces>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-rds)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

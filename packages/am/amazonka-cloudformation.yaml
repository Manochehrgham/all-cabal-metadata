  ## Version


  `1.3.7`



  ## Description


  AWS CloudFormation


  AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure

  deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS CloudFormation helps you

  leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and Auto

  Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective

  applications without worrying about creating and configuring the

  underlying AWS infrastructure.


  With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and

  dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of

  resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates

  and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all

  dependencies between the resources for you.


  For more information about this product, go to the

  <http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ CloudFormation Product Page>.


  Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need

  additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can

  find the product\''s technical documentation at

  <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/>.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudformation)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  ## Description


  AWS CloudFormation gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to

  create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and

  updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion. You can use AWS

  CloudFormation’s sample templates or create your own templates to describe

  the AWS resources, and any associated dependencies or runtime parameters,

  required to run your application. You don’t need to figure out the order for

  provisioning AWS services or the subtleties of making those dependencies

  work. CloudFormation takes care of this for you. After the AWS resources are

  deployed, you can modify and update them in a controlled and predictable way,

  in effect applying version control to your AWS infrastructure the same way

  you do with your software.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudformation)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

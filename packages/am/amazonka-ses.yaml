  ## Description


  Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cost-effective outbound-only

  email-sending service built on the reliable and scalable infrastructure that

  Amazon.com has developed to serve its own customer base. With Amazon SES, you

  can send transactional email, marketing messages, or any other type of

  high-quality content and you only pay for what you use. Along with high

  deliverability, Amazon SES provides easy, real-time access to your sending

  statistics and built-in notifications for bounces, complaints, and deliveries

  to help you fine-tune your email-sending strategy.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ses)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

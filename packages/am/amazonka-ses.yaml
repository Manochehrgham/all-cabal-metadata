  ## Version


  `1.0.1`



  ## Description


  Amazon Simple Email Service


  This is the API Reference for Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES).

  This documentation is intended to be used in conjunction with the

  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html Amazon SES Developer
  Guide>.


  For a list of Amazon SES endpoints to use in service requests, see

  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/regions.html Regions and Amazon
  SES>

  in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ses)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.

  Version\n\n`1.3.6`\n\n\n## Description\n\nSimple Systems Manager (SSM) is a set
  of capabilities that can help you\nmanage your Amazon EC2 instances running on Windows.
  SSM enables you to\nrun scripts or other common administrative tasks on your instances
  using\neither SSM Run Command or SSM Config.\n\nRun Command extends the server administration
  capabilities of SSM by\noffering an on-demand experience for executing commands.
  You can use\npre-defined Amazon SSM documents (formerly called configuration\ndocuments)
  to perform the actions listed later in this section, or you\ncan create your own
  documents. With these document, you can then\nremotely configure your instances
  by sending commands using the AWS\ncommand line interface (CLI), AWS Tools for Windows
  PowerShell, or the\n__Commands__ page in the Amazon EC2 console. Additionally, because
  Run\nCommand enables you to execute PowerShell commands or scripts, you can\nadminister
  your instances remotely using PowerShell as though you were\nlogged on locally to
  the instance. Run Command reports the status of the\ncommand execution for each
  instance targeted by a command. You can also\naudit the command execution to understand
  who executed commands, when,\nand what changes were made. By switching between different
  SSM\ndocuments, you can quickly configure your instances with different types\nof
  commands.\n\nSSM Config is a lightweight instance configuration solution. With SSM\nConfig,
  you can specify a setup configuration for your instances. SSM\nConfig is similar
  to EC2 User Data, which is another way of running\none-time scripts or applying
  settings during instance launch. SSM Config\nis an extension of this capability.
  Using SSM documents, you can specify\nwhich actions the system should perform on
  your instances, including\nwhich applications to install, which AWS Directory Service
  directory to\njoin, which Microsoft PowerShell modules to install, etc. If an instance\nis
  missing one or more of these configurations, the system makes those\nchanges. By
  default, the system checks every five minutes to see if\nthere is a new configuration
  to apply as defined in a new SSM document.\nIf so, the system updates the instances
  accordingly. In this way, you\ncan remotely maintain a consistent configuration
  baseline on your\ninstances. SSM Config is available using the AWS CLI or the AWS
  Tools\nfor Windows PowerShell.\n\nSSM is currently not supported on Linux instances.\n\nYou
  can use Run Command and SSM Config to do the following:\n\n-   Join an AWS Directory
  Service directory (SSM Config and Run Command)\n\n-   Install, repair, or uninstall
  software using an MSI package (SSM\n    Config and Run Command)\n\n-   Install PowerShell
  modules (SSM Config and Run Command)\n\n-   Configure CloudWatch Logs to monitor
  applications and systems (SSM\n    Config and Run Command)\n\n-   Run PowerShell
  commands or scripts (Run Command only)\n\n-   Update the EC2Config service (Run
  Command only)\n\n-   Configure Windows Update settings (Run Command only)\n\nSSM
  documents run with administrative privilege on Windows instances\nbecause the EC2Config
  service runs in the Local System account. If a\nuser has permission to execute any
  of the pre-defined SSM documents (any\ndocument that begins with AWS-*) then that
  user also has administrator\naccess to the instance. Delegate access to SSM Config
  and Run Command\njudiciously. This becomes extremely important if you create your
  own SSM\ndocuments. Amazon Web Services does not provide guidance about how to\ncreate
  secure SSM documents. You create SSM documents and delegate\naccess to Run Command
  actions at your own risk. As a security best\npractice, we recommend that you assign
  access to \\\"AWS-*\\\" documents,\nespecially the AWS-RunPowerShellScript document,
  to trusted\nadministrators only. You can create low-level SSM documents for low\nsecurity
  tasks and delegate access to non-administrators.\n\nDocumentation is available via
  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ssm)\nand the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ssm/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).\n\nThe
  types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>

  ## Version


  `1.3.3`



  ## Description


  Amazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) enables you to configure and

  manage your EC2 instances. You can create a configuration document and

  then associate it with one or more running instances.


  You can use a configuration document to automate the following tasks for

  your Windows instances:


  -   Join an AWS Directory


  -   Install, repair, or uninstall software using an MSI package


  -   Run PowerShell scripts


  -   Configure CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems


  Note that configuration documents are not supported on Linux instances.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-ssm)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ssm/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

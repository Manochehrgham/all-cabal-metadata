  Description\n\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs API Reference\n\nYou can use Amazon CloudWatch
  Logs to monitor, store, and access your\nlog files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
  (Amazon EC2) instances,\nAmazon CloudTrail, or other sources. You can then retrieve
  the\nassociated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the Amazon CloudWatch\nconsole,
  the CloudWatch Logs commands in the AWS CLI, the CloudWatch\nLogs API, or the CloudWatch
  Logs SDK.\n\nYou can use CloudWatch Logs to:\n\n-   __Monitor Logs from Amazon EC2
  Instances in Real-time__: You can use\n    CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications
  and systems using log data.\n    For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number
  of errors that\n    occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever\n
  \   the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify. CloudWatch Logs\n    uses
  your log data for monitoring; so, no code changes are required.\n    For example,
  you can monitor application logs for specific literal\n    terms (such as \\\"NullReferenceException\\\")
  or count the number of\n    occurrences of a literal term at a particular position
  in log data\n    (such as \\\"404\\\" status codes in an Apache access log). When
  the\n    term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the\n    data
  to a Amazon CloudWatch metric that you specify.\n\n-   __Monitor Amazon CloudTrail
  Logged Events__: You can create alarms\n    in Amazon CloudWatch and receive notifications
  of particular API\n    activity as captured by CloudTrail and use the notification
  to\n    perform troubleshooting.\n\n-   __Archive Log Data__: You can use CloudWatch
  Logs to store your log\n    data in highly durable storage. You can change the log
  retention\n    setting so that any log events older than this setting are\n    automatically
  deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to\n    quickly send both rotated
  and non-rotated log data off of a host and\n    into the log service. You can then
  access the raw log data when you\n    need it.\n\nDocumentation is available via
  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudwatch-logs)\nand the
  [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from this
  library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-cloudwatch-logs` is released
  under the [Mozilla Public License Version 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/).\n\nParts

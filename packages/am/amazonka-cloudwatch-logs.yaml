  ## Version


  `1.4.4`



  ## Description


  You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files
  from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon CloudTrail, or
  other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs
  using the Amazon CloudWatch console, the CloudWatch Logs commands in the AWS CLI,
  the CloudWatch Logs API, or the CloudWatch Logs SDK.


  You can use CloudWatch Logs to:


  -   __Monitor Logs from Amazon EC2 Instances in Real-time__: You can use CloudWatch
  Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch
  Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send
  you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify.
  CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring; so, no code changes are required.
  For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as
  \"NullReferenceException\") or count the number of occurrences of a literal term
  at a particular position in log data (such as \"404\" status codes in an Apache
  access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports
  the data to a Amazon CloudWatch metric that you specify.


  -   __Monitor Amazon CloudTrail Logged Events__: You can create alarms in Amazon
  CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail
  and use the notification to perform troubleshooting.


  -   __Archive Log Data__: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in
  highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so that any log
  events older than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent
  makes it easy to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host
  and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudwatch-logs)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

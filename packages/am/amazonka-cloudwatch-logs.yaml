  Description\n\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs API Reference\n\nThis is the /Amazon CloudWatch
  Logs API Reference/. Amazon CloudWatch\nLogs enables you to monitor, store, and
  access your system, application,\nand custom log files. This guide provides detailed
  information about\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs actions, data types, parameters, and errors.
  For\ndetailed information about Amazon CloudWatch Logs features and their\nassociated
  API calls, go to the\n<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide
  Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide>.\n\nUse the following links to get started using
  the /Amazon CloudWatch Logs\nAPI Reference/:\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html
  Actions>:\n    An alphabetical list of all Amazon CloudWatch Logs actions.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html
  Data Types>:\n    An alphabetical list of all Amazon CloudWatch Logs data types.\n-
  \  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html
  Common Parameters>:\n    Parameters that all Query actions can use.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html
  Common Errors>:\n    Client and server errors that all actions can return.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html
  Regions and Endpoints>:\n    Itemized regions and endpoints for all AWS products.\n\nIn
  addition to using the Amazon CloudWatch Logs API, you can also use\nthe following
  SDKs and third-party libraries to access Amazon CloudWatch\nLogs programmatically.\n\n-
  \  <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjava/ AWS SDK for Java Documentation>\n-
  \  <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkfornet/ AWS SDK for .NET Documentation>\n-
  \  <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforphp/ AWS SDK for PHP Documentation>\n-
  \  <http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforruby/ AWS SDK for Ruby Documentation>\n\nDevelopers
  in the AWS developer community also provide their own\nlibraries, which you can
  find at the following AWS developer centers:\n\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/java/
  AWS Java Developer Center>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/php/ AWS PHP Developer Center>\n-
  \  <http://aws.amazon.com/python/ AWS Python Developer Center>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/ruby/
  AWS Ruby Developer Center>\n-   <http://aws.amazon.com/net/ AWS Windows and .NET
  Developer Center>\n\nDocumentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudwatch-logs)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).\n\nThe
  types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-cloudwatch-logs` is released

  ## Description


  The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and regulatory

  compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated Hardware

  Security Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With CloudHSM, you

  control the encryption keys and cryptographic operations performed by the HSM.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudhsm)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/dg/welcome.html).

  ## Description


  Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable

  cross-device syncing of application-related user data. High-level client

  libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries

  to persist data locally so that it''s available even if the device is offline.

  Developer credentials don''t need to be stored on the mobile device to access

  the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and

  credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of

  key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cognito-sync)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitosync/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

  ## Description


  Amazon CloudSearch is a fully-managed service in the AWS Cloud that makes it

  your website or application. Amazon CloudSearch supports 34 languages and

  popular search features such as highlighting, autocomplete, and geospatial

  search.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudsearch)

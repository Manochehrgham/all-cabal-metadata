  ## Description


  Amazon CloudSearch is a fully-managed service in the AWS Cloud that makes it

  simple and cost-effective to set up, manage, and scale a search solution for

  your website or application. Amazon CloudSearch supports 34 languages and

  popular search features such as highlighting, autocomplete, and geospatial

  search.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-cloudsearch)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/what-is-cloudsearch.html).

  ## Description


  AWS OpsWorks provides a simple and flexible way to create and manage stacks

  and applications. With AWS OpsWorks, you can provision AWS resources, manage

  their configuration, deploy applications to those resources, and monitor

  their health.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-opsworks)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

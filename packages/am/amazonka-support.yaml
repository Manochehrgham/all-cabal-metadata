  Description\n\nAWS Support\n\nThe AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers
  who need detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This
  service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP
  methods that return results in JSON format.\n\nThe AWS Support service also exposes
  a set of <http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/ Trusted Advisor>
  features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results,
  specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.\n\nThe following
  list describes the AWS Support case management operations:\n\n-   __Service names,
  issue categories, and available severity levels.__ The < DescribeServices> and <
  DescribeSeverityLevels> operations return AWS service names, service codes, service
  categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the
  < CreateCase> operation.\n\n-   __Case creation, case details, and case resolution.__
  The < CreateCase>, < DescribeCases>, < DescribeAttachment>, and < ResolveCase> operations
  create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.\n\n-
  \  __Case communication.__ The < DescribeCommunications>, < AddCommunicationToCase>,
  and < AddAttachmentsToSet> operations retrieve and add communications and attachments
  to AWS Support cases.\n\nThe following list describes the operations available from
  the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:\n\n-   < DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks>
  returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources.\n\n-   Using the
  \n    @\n    checkId\n    @\n     for a specific check returned by < DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks>,
  you can call < DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult> to obtain the results for the
  check you specified.\n\n-   < DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries> returns summarized
  results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.\n\n-   < RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck>
  requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check.\n\n-   < DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses>
  reports the refresh status of one or more checks.\n\nFor authentication of requests,
  AWS Support uses <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html
  Signature Version 4 Signing Process>.\n\nSee <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html
  About the AWS Support API> in the /AWS Support User Guide/ for information about
  how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call
  Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.\n\nDocumentation is available
  via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-support)\nand the [AWS
  API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).\n\nThe types from this library
  are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-support` is released under the

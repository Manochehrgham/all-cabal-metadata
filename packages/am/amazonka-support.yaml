  ## Description


  AWS Support is a one-on-one, fast-response support channel that is staffed

  with experienced support personnel. The service helps customers get the most

  from the products and features provided by Amazon Web Services. There are

  four levels, or tiers, of AWS Support: Basic, Developer, Business, and

  Enterprise. The Basic tier is free of charge and offers support for account

  and billing questions and service limit increases. The other tiers offer an

  unlimited number of technical support cases with pay-by-the-month pricing and

  no long-term contracts, providing developers and businesses flexibility to

  choose the level of support that meets their needs.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-support)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

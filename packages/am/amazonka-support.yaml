description: ! 'AWS Support is a one-on-one, fast-response support channel that is
  staffed

  with experienced support personnel. The service helps customers get the most

  from the products and features provided by Amazon Web Services. There are

  four levels, or tiers, of AWS Support: Basic, Developer, Business, and

  Enterprise. The Basic tier is free of charge and offers support for account

  and billing questions and service limit increases. The other tiers offer an

  unlimited number of technical support cases with pay-by-the-month pricing and

  no long-term contracts, providing developers and businesses flexibility to

  choose the level of support that meets their needs.

  /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under

  heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!'

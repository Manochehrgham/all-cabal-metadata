description: ! 'Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides

  resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale

  computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface

  allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It

  provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you

  run on Amazon’s proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time

  required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to

  quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements

  change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay

  only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the

  tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from

  common failure scenarios.

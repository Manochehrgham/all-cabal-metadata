  ## Version


  `1.2.0`



  ## Description


  Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. Amazon S3 has

  a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve

  any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any

  developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast,

  inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own

  global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of

  scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-s3)

  and the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

  > _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`

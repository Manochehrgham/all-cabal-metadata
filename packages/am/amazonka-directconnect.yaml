  ## Version


  `1.4.2`



  ## Description


  AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect

  location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic

  cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an

  AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create

  virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon

  Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service

  (Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing

  Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect

  location provides access to AWS in the region it is associated with, as

  well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a

  single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use

  it to access public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud

  (US).


  Documentation is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-directconnect)

  and the [AWS API Reference](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/).


  The types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),

  which provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.


  Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.

  This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding

  de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.

  The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries

  [lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).

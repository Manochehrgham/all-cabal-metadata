  Description\n\nAWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network\nconnection
  from your premises to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS\nDirect Connect, you
  can establish private connectivity between AWS and\nyour data center, office, or
  colocation environment, which in many cases\ncan reduce your network costs, increase
  bandwidth throughput, and\nprovide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based\nconnections.\n\nThe
  AWS Direct Connect API Reference provides descriptions, syntax, and\nusage examples
  for each of the actions and data types for AWS Direct\nConnect. Use the following
  links to get started using the /AWS Direct\nConnect API Reference/:\n\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html
  Actions>:\n    An alphabetical list of all AWS Direct Connect actions.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html
  Data Types>:\n    An alphabetical list of all AWS Direct Connect data types.\n-
  \  <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/CommonParameters.html
  Common Query Parameters>:\n    Parameters that all Query actions can use.\n-   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html
  Common Errors>:\n    Client and server errors that all actions can return.\n\nDocumentation
  is available via [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka-directconnect)\nand
  the [AWS API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).\n\nThe
  types from this library are intended to be used with [amazonka](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka),\nwhich
  provides mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.\n\nUse
  of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.\nThis is due to the
  amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding\nde/serialisation into
  more palatable Haskell values.\nThe provided lenses should be compatible with any
  of the major lens libraries\n[lens](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) or
  [lens-family-core](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core).\n\n## Contribute\n\nFor
  any problems, comments, or feedback please create an issue [here on GitHub](https://github.com/brendanhay/amazonka/issues).\n\n>
  _Note:_ this library is an auto-generated Haskell package. Please see `amazonka-gen`
  for more information.\n\n\n## Licence\n\n`amazonka-directconnect` is released under

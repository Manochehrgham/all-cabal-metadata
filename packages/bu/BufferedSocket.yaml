description: The idea of a "BufferedSocket" is that reading from a network socket
  should be really easy and handy. BufferedSockets is an attempt to do just that whilst
  being space-time efficient. Having "in app" buffers also makes it easy for the buffered
  socket to read data without taking the data out of the buffer thus giving us the
  ability to look for patterns and read excess data without having to "take out of
  the reading queue".

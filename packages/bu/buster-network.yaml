description: ! 'Buster is best described by the following blog post: http:\/\/vis.renci.org\/jeff\/2009\/03\/31\/almost-but-not-quite-entirely-like-frp\/


  It is an engine for orchestrating large, complex, and multifaceted applications
  by couching them in terms of time, events, a bus,

  behaviours, and widgets.  Time is continuous and infininte.  Events are discrete
  and exist for a particular time.  The bus is a

  discrete sample of time made available to behaviours. Behaviours are continuous
  and exist for all time, but sample time via

  the bus.  They filter Events to determine what is on the bus at future times.  Widgets
  are input-only objects that sample the

  outside world and assign events to discrete portions of time.


  Buster is designed to be flexible, with a flexible event model and the ability to
  add custom data to events, and designed to be

  high performance.  It is simple to integrate with Gtk while at the same time able
  to handle other kinds of resources, like files

  and sockets.'

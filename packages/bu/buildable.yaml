description: ! 'Various linear data structures can be expensive to construct in a

  repetitive fashion.  For example, to append a single value to the end

  of a list is @O(n)@, and as such doing so repeatedly is recommended

  against.


  As such, to efficiently construct such structures we have the notion

  of a /builder/.  This can be used to more efficiently prepend and

  append values, and at the end we \"run\" the builder to construct the

  overall value.


  This module provides an abstraction over various builders for specific

  data structures.  It also aims to minimise the number of functions

  required to add various values to the builder by using a typeclass and

  newtype wrappers.


  To construct a value from it''s builder:


  1. Start with either @''mempty''@ for an empty ''Builder'', or if you

  have an initial value use @''fromValue''@.


  2. Add initial values to the front or back using ''prepend'' \/ ''<|''

  or ''append'' \/ ''|>'' respectively.


  3. Once you''ve finished constructing your builder, create your

  final value with ''build''.


  /Note/: all instances are defined for both strict and lazy

  @ByteString@ and @Text@ values.'

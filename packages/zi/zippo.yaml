description: ! 'This light-weight library provides a basic, but fully-type-checked

  zipper implementation, suitable for any algebraic data structure.

  Our implementation has no notion of \"left\" and \"right\", and

  instead uses lenses (from the "yall" package) to indicate directions

  to \"navigate down to\".


  For a similar approach with many more features, but less type-safety

  see "pez".


  /UPDATE/: I have stopped developing this package; instead look into "lens" v3.0
  which includes similar functionality


  /CHANGES/: 0.2 to 0.3:


  - depend on new yall, depending on new categories'

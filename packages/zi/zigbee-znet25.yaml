description: ! 'A protocol library enabling wireless communications via

  XBee/XBee-PRO (ZibBee) ZNet 2.5 RF modules.


  The library performs binary encoding/decoding, on-the-wire framing,

  and error checking of control and data "API" frames.  In other words

  the library expects to communicate with an XBee modem that has AP

  parameter = 2, indicating API frames with HDLC-like escape characters.

  This mode provides for 8-bit transparent operation and is described in

  Section 6 of <ftp://ftp1.digi.com/support/documentation/90000866_C.pdf>.


  The library code is 100% pure; nothing here depends on the

  IO monad and no particular modem device is assumed.  The code

  depends on the @cereal@ package for serialization but is otherwise

  pretty standard.  The test suite is based on @QuickCheck@ properties.'

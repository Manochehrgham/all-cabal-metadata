synopsis: A basic library for SI/binary prefix units
changelog: ! "Version 0.1.0.2\n\n* Trivial release for compatibility with QuickCheck
  2.7 and older\n  HUnit packages as found in Wheezy.\n* The release switches the
  test suite to use Cabal macros, which might\n  create issues in some cases.\n\nVersion
  0.1.0.1\n\n* Trivial release updating upper package bounds (for testing),\n  updating
  homepage/related settings as part of move to github, and\n  fixing a few documentation
  issues.\n\nVersion 0.1.0\n\n* Initial release.\n"

description: ! "prefix-units package\n====================\n\nThis package defines
  a datatype (`Unit`) and associated\nparsing/formatting functions so that command
  line applications can\nhandle \"nice\" values like:\n\n    $ cmd create-file foo
  100G\n    Done.\n    $ cmd ls-file foo\n    Size is 100Gi\n    $ cmd ls-files\n
  \   foo 100Gi\n    bar  14Ki\n\nAnd so on. For details on the API, look at the Haddock
  documentation\nfor the `Data.Prefix.Units` module.\n\nFor building and installing,
  `cabal configure` and related commands\nare enough. Run `cabal configure --enable-tests
  && cabal build &&\ncabal test` if you want to run the unit-tests.\n\nThe library
  is designed to have very few dependencies (only base and a\nfew GHC extensions),
  so that it's trivial to use it in projects. Hence\nthe use of some hand-coded conversions
  instead of using\nTemplateHaskell to generate them automatically.\n\nTODO\n----\n\nThe
  current interface of the library works, but is not nicely\ncomposable. I'm still
  looking for a nicer way to expose the parsing\nfunctionality.\n\nCurrently, the
  binary and SI units are mixed in the same\ndata-type. This works, but at some level
  I think two separate types\nwould be more \"correct\", at the expense of a more
  complex API.\n\nThe RationalConvertible type class has only a few instances; ideally\nwe'd
  have `instance Integral a => RationalConvertible a` and similar\nfor `Fractional`,
  but this doesn't work as such in Haskell, so we're\nstuck with the manual derivation.\n\nThe
  current behaviour is case-sensitive for all units in `ParseExact`\nmode, which means
  that one has to use (in this mode) `Ki` for the\nbinary unit `Kibi`. This seems
  suboptimal, since the binary units are\nunique irrespective of casing.\n"

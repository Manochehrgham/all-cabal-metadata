description: ! '"Prelude.EDSL" exports a small subset of the "Prelude":

  some standard types and classes plus a small number of

  convenience functions.


  The motivation for this module is that it is common for

  deeply embedded domain-specific languages (EDSLs) to

  redefine identifiers from the "Prelude", so EDSL users must

  hide the "Prelude" in their programs. However, there are

  certain useful things from the "Prelude" that are usually

  not redefined -- function composition being one example --

  so it becomes quite awkward to have to hide everything from

  the "Prelude".


  The reason for exporting e.g the @Num@ class but not @Ord@

  is that it is possible to give an instance for deep

  embeddings of the former but not the latter. For example,

  assuming @Exp@ is the type of a deep embedding, we can have


  > (+) :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp


  but not


  > (<) :: Exp -> Exp -> Exp


  (because @(<)@ has a @Bool@ result, regardless of the type

  of the arguments).'

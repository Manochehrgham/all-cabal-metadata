description: ! 'Test.Properties is flexible and readable way of codifing and executing
  assertions.

  The properties can be defined right within the class or the code for which the

  properties apply.


  Instead of testing properties with automatically generate values in a separate

  test program,this package permits to test them on the fly while the real application
  run,

  with the data produced within. So somehow it unites the readability of

  QuickCheck and the flexibility of assert.  It is simple and straighforward

  But is by no means perfect. no statistics and so on. Just trace messages are

  sent.


  The primary purpose of this package was to define class properties

  and to check their instances. The properties can be defined within a class.

  so no additional exports are necessary. checking instaces can be done within

  the instance declarations. But it can be used anywhere assertions

  are used. It can be attached to arbitrary piece of code for which

  the property group holds. The defined properties can be used for casual

  debugging.


  The package includes  complete examples.'

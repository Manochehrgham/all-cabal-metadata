synopsis: property-based host configuration management in haskell
changelog: ! "propellor (2.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Make propellor resistent
  to changes to shared libraries, such as libffi,\n    which might render the propellor
  binary unable to run. This is dealt with\n    by checking the binary both when running
  propellor on a remote host,\n    and by Cron.runPropellor. If the binary doesn't
  work, it will be rebuilt.\n  * Note that since a new switch had to be added to allow
  testing the binary,\n    upgrading to this version will cause a rebuild from scratch
  of propellor.\n  * Added hasLoginShell and shellEnabled.\n  * debCdn changed to
  new httpredir.debian.org official replacement for\n    http.debian.net.\n  * API
  change: Added User and Group newtypes, and Properties that\n    used to use the
  type UserName = String were changed to use them.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Wed, 22 Apr 2015 13:46:24 -0400\n\npropellor (2.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * userScriptProperty now passes --shell /bin/sh, so it can be used\n    even for
  users with nonstandard shells.\n  * Fix bug in docker propellor shim setup introduced
  in last release,\n    which broke provisioning of new docker containers.\n\n --
  Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 12 Mar 2015 20:08:34 -0400\n\npropellor (2.2.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * When running shimmed (eg in a docker container),\n
  \   improve process name visible in ps.\n  * Add shebang to cron.daily etc files.
  \n  * Some changes to tor configuration, minor API change.\n  * Propellor now builds
  itself, and gets its build dependencies installed\n    when deploying to a new host,
  without needing the Makefile.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 09 Mar 2015
  12:02:31 -0400\n\npropellor (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Additional tor
  properties, including support for making relays, \n    and naming bridges, relays,
  etc.\n  * New Cron.Times data type, which allows Cron.job to install\n    daily/monthly/weekly
  jobs that anacron can run. (API change)\n  * Fix Git.daemonRunning to restart inetd
  after enabling the git server.\n  * Ssh.authorizedKey: Make the authorized_keys
  file and .ssh directory\n    be owned by the user, not root.\n  * Ssh.knownHost:
  Make the .ssh directory be owned by the user, not root.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Thu, 12 Feb 2015 12:36:26 -0400\n\npropellor (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Property has been converted to a GADT, and will be Property NoInfo\n    or Property
  HasInfo.\n    This was done to make sure that ensureProperty is only used on\n    properties
  that do not have Info.\n    Transition guide:\n    - Change all \"Property\" to
  \"Property NoInfo\" or \"Property WithInfo\"\n      (The compiler can tell you if
  you got it wrong!)\n    - To construct a RevertableProperty, it is useful to use
  the new\n      (<!>) operator\n    - Constructing a list of properties can be problimatic,
  since\n      Property NoInto and Property WithInfo are different types and cannot\n
  \     appear in the same list. To deal with this, \"props\" has been added,\n      and
  can built up a list of properties of different types,\n      using the same (&)
  and (!) operators that are used to build\n      up a host's properties.\n  * Add
  descriptions of how to set missing fields to --list-fields output.\n  * Properties
  now form a tree, instead of the flat list used before.\n    This includes the properties
  used inside a container.\n  * Fix info propagation from fallback combinator's second
  Property.\n  * Added systemd configuration properties.\n  * Added journald configuration
  properties.\n  * Added more network interface configuration properties.\n  * Implemented
  OS.preserveNetwork.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 25 Jan 2015 15:23:08
  -0400\n\npropellor (1.3.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * SSHFP records are also
  generated for CNAMES of hosts.\n  * Merge Utiity modules from git-annex.\n  * Ignore
  bogus DNS when spinning the local host.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 15
  Jan 2015 14:02:07 -0400\n\npropellor (1.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix
  bug that prevented deploying ssh host keys when the file for the\n    key didn't
  already exist.\n  * DNS records for hosts with known ssh public keys now automatically\n
  \   include SSHFP records.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 04 Jan 2015 19:51:34
  -0400\n\npropellor (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * --spin checks if the
  DNS matches any configured IP address property\n    of the host, and if not, sshes
  to the host by IP address.\n  * Detect #774376 and refuse to use docker if the system
  is so broken\n    that docker exec doesn't enter a chroot.\n  * Update intermediary
  propellor in --spin --via\n  * Added support for DNSSEC.\n  * Ssh.hostKey and Ssh.hostKeys
  no longer install public keys from\n    the privdata. Instead, the public keys are
  included in the\n    configuration. (API change)\n  * Ssh.hostKeys now removes any
  host keys of types that the host is not\n    configured to have.\n  * sshPubKey
  is renamed to Ssh.pubKey, and has an added SshKeyType\n    parameter. (API change)\n
  \ * CloudAtCost.deCruft no longer forces randomHostKeys.\n  * Fix build with process
  1.2.1.0.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 04 Jan 2015 17:17:44 -0400\n\npropellor
  (1.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Revert ensureProperty warning message, too
  many false positives in places\n    where Info is correctly propigated. Better approach
  needed.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 21 Dec 2014 21:41:11 -0400\n\npropellor
  (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added CryptPassword to PrivDataField, for
  password hashes as produced \n    by crypt(3).\n  * User.hasPassword and User.hasSomePassword
  will now use either\n    a CryptPassword or a Password from privdata, depending
  on which is set.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:30:44 -0400\n\npropellor
  (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Display a warning when ensureProperty is
  used on a property which has\n    Info and is so prevented from propigating it.\n
  \ * Removed boolProperty; instead the new toResult can be used. (API change)\n  *
  Include Propellor.Property.OS, which was accidentially left out of the\n    cabal
  file in the last release.\n  * Fix Apache.siteEnabled to update the config file
  and reload apache when\n    configuration has changed.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:05:09 -0400\n\npropellor (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * --spin target --via relay causes propellor to bounce through an\n    intermediate
  relay host, which handles any necessary uploads\n    when provisioning the target
  host.\n  * --spin can be passed multiple hosts, and it will provision each host\n
  \   in turn.\n  * Add --merge, to combine multiple --spin commits into a single,
  more useful\n    commit.\n  * Hostname parameters not containing dots are looked
  up in the DNS to\n    find the full hostname.\n  * propellor --spin can now deploy
  propellor to hosts that do not have \n    git, ghc, or apt-get. This is accomplished
  by uploading a fairly\n    portable precompiled tarball of propellor.\n  * Propellor.Property.OS
  contains properties that can be used to do a clean\n    reinstall of the OS of an
  existing host. This can be used, for example,\n    to do an in-place conversion
  from Fedora to Debian.\n    This is experimental; use with caution!\n  * Added group-related
  properties. Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Added Git.barerepo. Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n
  \ * Added Grub.installed and Grub.boots properties.\n  * New HostContext can be
  specified when a PrivData value varies per host.\n  * hasSomePassword and hasPassword
  now default to using HostContext.\n    To specify a different context, use hasSomePassword'
  and\n    hasPassword' (API change)\n  * hasSomePassword and hasPassword now make
  sure shadow passwords are enabled.\n  * cron.runPropellor now runs propellor, rather
  than using its Makefile.\n    This is more robust.\n  * propellor.debug can be set
  in the git config to enable more persistent\n    debugging output.\n  * Run apt-cache
  policy with LANG=C so it works on other locales.\n  * endAction can be used to register
  an action to run once propellor\n    has successfully run on a host.\n\n -- Joey
  Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 07 Dec 2014 15:23:59 -0400\n\npropellor (1.0.0) unstable;
  urgency=medium\n\n  * propellor --spin can now be used to update remote hosts, without\n
  \   any central git repository needed. The central git repository is\n    still
  useful for running propellor from cron, but this simplifies\n    getting started
  with propellor, and allows for more ad-hoc usage.\n  * The git repo url, if any,
  is updated whenever propellor --spin is used.\n  * Added prosody module, contributed
  by Félix Sipma.\n  * Can be used to configure tor hidden services. Thanks, Félix
  Sipma.\n  * When multiple gpg keys are added, ensure that the privdata file\n    can
  be decrypted by all of them.\n  * Convert GpgKeyId to newtype. (API change)\n  *
  DigitalOcean.distroKernel property now reboots into the distribution\n    kernel
  when necessary.\n  * Avoid outputting color setting sequences when not run on a
  terminal.\n  * Docker code simplified by using `docker exec`; needs docker 1.3.1.\n
  \ * Docker containers are now a separate data type, cannot be included\n    in the
  main host list, and are instead passed to\n    Docker.docked. (API change)\n  *
  Added support for using debootstrap from propellor.\n  * Propellor can now be used
  to provision chroots.\n  * systemd-nspawn containers can now be managed by propellor,
  very similar\n    to its handling of docker containers.\n  * Debian package will
  be maintained by Gergely Nagy.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 21 Nov 2014
  20:58:02 -0400\n\npropellor (0.9.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added nginx
  module, contributed by Félix Sipma.\n  * Added firewall module, contributed by Arnaud
  Bailly.\n  * Apache: Fix daemon reload when enabling a new module or site.\n  *
  Docker: Stop using docker.io; that was a compat symlink in\n    the Debian package
  which has been removed in docker.io 1.3.1~dfsg1-2.\n  * Orphaned the Debian package,
  as I am retiring from Debian.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 08 Nov 2014
  15:57:36 -0400\n\npropellor (0.9.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Docker: Add
  ability to control when containers restart.\n  * Docker: Default to always restarting
  containers, so they come back \n    up after reboots and docker daemon upgrades.
  (API change)\n  * Fix loop when a docker host that does not exist was docked.\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 2014 09:57:31 -0400\n\npropellor (0.9.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Avoid encoding the current stable suite in propellor's
  code,\n    since that poses a difficult transition around the release,\n    and
  can easily be wrong if an older version of propellor is used.\n    Instead, the
  os property for a stable system includes the suite name\n    to use, eg Stable \"wheezy\".\n
  \ * stdSourcesList uses the stable suite name, to avoid unwanted\n    immediate
  upgrades to the next stable release. (API change)\n  * debCdn switched from cdn.debian.net
  to http.debian.net, which seems to be\n    better managed now.\n  * Docker: Avoid
  committing container every time it's started up.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Fri, 10 Oct 2014 11:37:45 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * The Debian package now includes a single-revision git repository in\n    /usr/src/propellor/,
  and ~/.propellor/ is set up to use this repository as\n    its origin remote. This
  avoids relying on the security of the github\n    repository when using the Debian
  package.\n  * The /usr/bin/propellor wrapper will warn when ~/.propellor/ is out
  of date\n    and a newer version is available, after which git merge upstream/master\n
  \   can be run to merge it.\n  * Included the config.hs symlink to config-simple.hs
  in the cabal and Debian\n    packages.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,
  22 Aug 2014 13:02:01 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  *
  Fix bug in File.containsLines that caused lines that were already in the\n    file
  to sometimes be appended to the end.\n  * Hostname.sane also configures /etc/mailname.\n
  \ * Fixed Postfix.satellite to really configure relayhost = smtp.domain.\n  * Avoid
  reconfiguring postfix unncessarily when it already has a relayhost.\n  * Deal with
  apache 2.4's change in the name of site-available config files.\n  * Hostname aliases
  can now be used in several places, including --spin\n    and Ssh.knownHost.\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 04 Aug 2014 01:12:19 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.1)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Run apt-get update in initial bootstrap.\n  * --list-fields
  now includes a table of fields that are not currently set,\n    but would be used
  if they got set.\n  * Remove .gitignore from cabal file list, to avoid build failure
  on Debian.\n    Closes: #754334\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Jul
  2014 22:11:31 -0400\n\npropellor (0.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Completely
  reworked privdata storage. There is now a single file,\n    and each host is sent
  only the privdata that its Properties actually use.\n\n    To transition existing
  privdata, run propellor against a host and\n    watch out for the red failure messages,
  and run the suggested commands\n    to store the privdata using the new storage
  scheme. You may find\n    it useful to run the old version of propellor to extract
  data from the old\n    privdata files during this migration.\n\n    Several properties
  that use privdata now require a context to be\n    specified. If in doubt, you can
  use anyContext, or\n    Context \"hostname.example.com\"\n\n  * Add --edit to edit
  a privdata value in $EDITOR.\n  * Add --list-fields to list all currently set privdata
  fields, along with\n    the hosts that use them.\n  * Fix randomHostKeys property
  to run openssh-server's postinst in a\n    non-failing way.\n  * Hostname.sane now
  cleans up the 127.0.0.1 localhost line in /etc/hosts,\n    to avoid eg, apache complaining
  \"Could not reliably determine the\n    server's fully qualified domain name\".\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 06 Jul 2014 18:28:08 -0400\n\npropellor (0.7.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * combineProperties no longer stops when a property
  fails; now it continues\n    trying to satisfy all properties on the list before
  propigating the\n    failure.\n  * Attr is renamed to Info. (API change)\n  * Renamed
  wrapper to propellor to make cabal installation of propellor work.\n  * When git
  gpg signature of a fetched git branch cannot be verified,\n    propellor will now
  continue running, but without merging in that branch.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Fri, 13 Jun 2014 10:06:40 -0400\n\npropellor (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Docker containers now propagate DNS attributes out to the host they're\n    docked
  in. So if a docker container sets a DNS alias, every container\n    it's docked
  in will automatically be added to a DNS round-robin,\n    when propellor is used
  to manage DNS for the domain.\n  * Apt.stdSourcesList no longer needs a suite to
  be specified. (API change)\n  * Added --dump to dump out a field of a host's privdata.
  Useful for editing\n    it.\n  * Propellor's output now includes the hostname being
  provisioned, or\n    when provisioning a docker container, the container name.\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 05 Jun 2014 17:32:14 -0400\n\npropellor (0.5.3)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix unattended-upgrades config for !stable.\n  *
  Ensure that kernel hostname is same as /etc/hostname when configuring\n    hostname.\n
  \ * Added modules for some hosting providers (DigitalOcean, CloudAtCost).\n\n --
  Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 29 May 2014 14:29:53 -0400\n\npropellor (0.5.2)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * A bug that caused propellor to hang when updating
  a running docker\n    container appears to have been fixed. Note that since it affects\n
  \   the propellor process that serves as \"init\" of docker containers,\n    they
  have to be restarted for the fix to take effect.\n  * Licence changed from GPL to
  BSD.\n  * A few changes to allow building Propellor on OSX. One user reports\n    successfully
  using it there.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 17 May 2014 16:42:55 -0400\n\npropellor
  (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Primary DNS servers now have allow-transfer
  automatically populated\n    with the IP addresses of secondary dns servers. So,
  it's important\n    that all secondary DNS servers have an ipv4 (and/or ipv6) property\n
  \   configured.\n  * Deal with old ssh connection caching sockets.\n  * Add missing
  build deps and deps. Closes: #745459\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24
  Apr 2014 18:09:58 -0400\n\npropellor (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Removed
  root domain records from SOA. Instead, use RootDomain\n    when calling Dns.primary.
  (API change)\n  * Dns primary and secondary properties are now revertable.\n  *
  When unattendedUpgrades is enabled on an Unstable or Testing system,\n    configure
  it to allow the upgrades.\n  * New website, https://propellor.branchable.com/\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2014 17:38:02 -0400\n\npropellor (0.4.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Propellor can configure primary DNS servers, including
  generating\n    zone files, which is done by looking at the properties of hosts\n
  \   in a domain.\n  * The `cname` property was renamed to `alias` as it does not
  always\n    generate CNAME in the DNS. (API change)\n  * Constructor of Property
  has changed (use `property` function instead).\n    (API change)\n  * All Property
  combinators now combine together their Attr settings.\n    So Attr settings can
  be made inside a propertyList, for example.\n  * Run all cron jobs under chronic
  from moreutils to avoid unnecessary\n    mails.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
  \ Sat, 19 Apr 2014 02:09:56 -0400\n\npropellor (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Merge scheduler bug fix from git-annex.\n  * Support for provisioning hosts
  with ssh and gpg keys.\n  * Obnam support.\n  * Apache support.\n  * Postfix satellite
  system support.\n  * Properties can now be satisfied differently on different operating\n
  \   systems.\n  * Standard apt configuration for stable now includes backports.\n
  \ * Cron jobs generated by propellor use flock(1) to avoid multiple\n    instances
  running at a time.\n  * Add support for SSH ed25519 keys.\n    (Thanks, Franz Pletz.)\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Apr 2014 20:07:33 -0400\n\npropellor (0.3.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * ipv6to4: Ensure interface is brought up automatically
  on boot.\n  * Enabling unattended upgrades now ensures that cron is installed and\n
  \   running to perform them.\n  * Properties can be scheduled to only be checked
  after a given time period.\n  * Fix bootstrapping of dependencies.\n  * Fix compilation
  on Debian stable.\n  * Include security updates in sources.list for stable and testing.\n
  \ * Use ssh connection caching, especially when bootstrapping.\n  * Properties now
  run in a Propellor monad, which provides access to\n    attributes of the host.
  (API change)\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Apr 2014 01:19:05 -0400\n\npropellor
  (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * docker: Fix laziness bug that caused running
  containers to be\n    unnecessarily stopped and committed.\n  * Add locking so only
  one propellor can run at a time on a host.\n  * docker: When running as effective
  init inside container, wait on zombies.\n  * docker: Added support for configuring
  shared volumes and linked\n    containers.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,
  08 Apr 2014 02:07:37 -0400\n\npropellor (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  *
  Now supports provisioning docker containers with architecture/libraries\n    that
  do not match the host.\n  * Fixed a bug that caused file modes to be set to 600
  when propellor\n    modified the file (did not affect newly created files).\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Apr 2014 01:07:32 -0400\n\npropellor (0.2.1)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * First release with Debian package.\n\n -- Joey Hess
  <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 03 Apr 2014 01:43:14 -0400\n\npropellor (0.2.0) unstable;
  urgency=low\n\n  * Added support for provisioning Docker containers.\n  * Bootstrap
  deployment now pushes the git repo to the remote host\n    over ssh, securely.\n
  \ * propellor --add-key configures a gpg key, and makes propellor refuse\n    to
  pull commits from git repositories not signed with that key.\n    This allows propellor
  to be securely used with public, non-encrypted\n    git repositories without the
  possibility of MITM.\n  * Added support for type-safe reversions. Only some properties
  can be\n    reverted; the type checker will tell you if you try something that won't\n
  \   work.\n  * New syntactic sugar for building a list of properties, including\n
  \   revertable properties.\n\n -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Apr 2014

description: ! "[Propellor](https://propellor.branchable.com/) is a\nconfiguration
  management system using Haskell and Git.\nEach system has a list of properties,
  which Propellor ensures\nare satisfied.\n\nPropellor is configured via a git repository,
  which typically lives\nin `~/.propellor/` on your development machine. Propellor
  clones the\nrepository to each host it manages, in a \n[secure](http://propellor.branchable.com/security/)
  way. See [[components]]\nfor details.\n\nProperties are defined using Haskell. Edit
  `~/.propellor/config.hs`\nto get started. There is fairly complete \n[API documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/),\nwhich
  includes many built-in Properties for dealing with\n[Apt](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Apt.html)\nand\n[Apache](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Apache.html)\n,\n[Cron](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Cron.html)\nand\n[Commands](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Cmd.html)\n,\n[Dns](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Dns.html)\nand\n[Docker](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Docker.html),
  etc.\n\nThere is no special language as used in puppet, chef, ansible, etc.. just\nthe
  full power of Haskell. Hopefully that power can be put to good use in\nmaking declarative
  properties that are powerful, nicely idempotent, and\neasy to adapt to a system's
  special needs!\n\nIf using Haskell to configure Propellor seems intimidating,\nsee
  [configuration for the Haskell newbie](https://propellor.branchable.com/haskell_newbie/).\n\n##
  quick start\n\n1. Get propellor installed on your development machine (ie, laptop).\n
  \    `cabal install propellor`\n          or\n     `apt-get install propellor`\n2.
  Run `propellor` for the first time. It will set up a `~/.propellor/` git\n   repository
  for you.\n3. If you don't have a gpg private key already, generate one: `gpg --gen-key`\n4.
  Run: `propellor --add-key $KEYID`, which will make propellor trust\n   your gpg
  key, and will sign your `~/.propellor` repository using it.\n5. Edit `~/.propellor/config.hs`,
  and add a host you want to manage.\n   You can start by not adding any properties,
  or only a few.\n6. Run: `propellor --spin $HOST`\n7. Now you have a simple propellor
  deployment, but it doesn't do\n   much to the host yet, besides installing propellor.
  \ \n   So, edit `~/.propellor/config.hs` to configure the host, add some\n   properties
  to it, and re-run step 6.  \n   Repeat until happy and move on to the next host.
  :)\n8. Optionally, set up a [centralized git repository](https://propellor.branchable.com/centralized_git_repository/)\n
  \  so that multiple hosts can be updated with a simple `git commit -S; git push`\n9.
  Write some neat new properties and send patches!\n"

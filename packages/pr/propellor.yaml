changelog: ! "propellor (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * propellor --init now
  runs cabal sandbox init if cabal has been\n    configured with require-sandbox:
  True.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Re-bundled concurrent-output so propellor can
  be deployed to Debian\n    stable systems without installing it (insecurely) from
  hackage.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 05 Apr 2016 13:35:54 -0400\n\npropellor
  (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Property types have been improved to indicate
  what systems they target.\n    This prevents using eg, Property FreeBSD on a Debian
  system.\n    Transition guide for this sweeping API change:\n    - First, upgrade
  to propellor 2.17.2 and deploy that to all your hosts.\n      Otherwise, propellor
  --spin will fail when you upgrade to\n      propellor 3.0.0.\n    - Change \"host
  name & foo & bar\"\n      to     \"host name $ props & foo & bar\"\n    - Similarly,
  `propertyList` and `combineProperties` need `props`\n      to be used to combine
  together properties; they no longer accept\n      lists of properties. (If you have
  such a list, use `toProps`.)\n    - And similarly, Chroot, Docker, and Systemd container
  need `props`\n      to be used to combine together the properies used inside them.\n
  \   - The `os` property is removed. Instead use `osDebian`, `osBuntish`,\n      or
  `osFreeBSD`. These tell the type checker the target OS of a host.\n    - Change
  \"Property NoInfo\" to \"Property UnixLike\"\n    - Change \"Property HasInfo\"
  to \"Property (HasInfo + UnixLike)\"\n    - Change \"RevertableProperty NoInfo\"
  to\n      \"RevertableProperty UnixLike UnixLike\"\n    - Change \"RevertableProperty
  HasInfo\" to\n      \"RevertableProperty (HasInfo + UnixLike) UnixLike\"\n    -
  GHC needs {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-} to use these fancy types.\n      This is
  enabled by default for all modules in propellor.cabal. But\n      if you are using
  propellor as a library, you may need to enable it\n      manually.\n    - If you
  know a property only works on a particular OS, like Debian\n      or FreeBSD, use
  that instead of \"UnixLike\". For example:\n      \"Property Debian\"\n    - It's
  also possible make a property support a set of OS's, for example:\n      \"Property
  (Debian + FreeBSD)\"\n    - Removed `infoProperty` and `simpleProperty` constructors,
  instead use\n      `property` to construct a Property.\n    - Due to the polymorphic
  type returned by `property`, additional type\n      signatures tend to be needed
  when using it. For example, this will\n      fail to type check, because the type
  checker cannot guess what type\n      you intend the intermediate property \"go\"
  to have:\n        foo :: Property UnixLike\n        foo = go `requires` bar\n \t
  \ where\n \t\tgo = property \"foo\" (return NoChange)\n      To fix, specify the
  type of go:\n \t  \tgo :: Property UnixLike\n    - `ensureProperty` now needs to
  be passed a witness to the type of the \n      property it's used in.\n      change
  this:  foo = property desc $ ... ensureProperty bar\n      to this:      foo = property'
  desc $ \\w -> ... ensureProperty w bar\n    - General purpose properties like cmdProperty
  have type \"Property UnixLike\".\n      When using that to run a command only available
  on Debian, you can\n      tighten the type to only the OS that your more specific
  property works on.\n      For example:\n        upgraded :: Property Debian\n        upgraded
  = tightenTargets (cmdProperty \"apt-get\" [\"upgrade\"])\n    - Several utility
  functions have been renamed:\n      getInfo to fromInfo\n      propertyInfo to getInfo\n
  \     propertyDesc to getDesc\n      propertyChildren to getChildren\n  * The new
  `pickOS` property combinator can be used to combine different\n    properties, supporting
  different OS's, into one Property that chooses\n    which to use based on the Host's
  OS.\n  * Re-enabled -O0 in propellor.cabal to reign in ghc's memory use handling\n
  \   these complex new types.\n  * Added dependency on concurrent-output; removed
  embedded copy.\n  * Apt.PPA: New module, contributed by Evan Cofsky.\n  * Improved
  propellor's first run experience; propellor --init will\n    walk the user through
  setting up ~/.propellor, with a choice between\n    a clone of propellor's git repository,
  or a minimal config, and will\n    configure propellor to use a gpg key.\n  * Stack
  support. \"git config propellor.buildsystem stack\" will make\n    propellor build
  its config using stack.\n  * When propellor is installed using stack, propellor
  --init will\n    automatically set propellor.buildsystem=stack.\n\n -- Joey Hess
  <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 02 Apr 2016 15:33:26 -0400\n\npropellor (2.17.2) unstable;
  urgency=medium\n\n  * When new dependencies are added to propellor or the propellor
  config,\n    try harder to get them installed. In particular, this makes \n    propellor
  --spin work when the remote host needs to get dependencies\n    installed in order
  to build the updated config.\n  * Apt.update: Also run dpkg --configure -a here
  as apt for some reason\n    won't even update if dpkg was interrupted.\n\n -- Joey

  urgency=medium\n\n  * Avoid generating excessively long paths to the unix socket
  file\n    used for ssh connection caching. Mostly. Can still generate a too long\n
  \   one if $HOME is longer than 60 bytes.\n  * Uwsgi: add \".ini\" extension to
  app config files. \n    Files without extensions were ignored by uwsgi.\n    Thanks,
  Félix Sipma.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 28 Mar 2016 11:06:34 -0400\n\npropellor
  (2.17.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added initial support for FreeBSD.\n    Thanks,
  Evan Cofsky.\n  * Added Propellor.Property.ZFS.\n    Thanks, Evan Cofsky.\n  * Firewall:
  Reorganized Chain data type. (API change)\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Firewall:
  Separated Table and Target (API change)\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Ssh: change
  type of listenPort from Int to Port (API change)\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  *
  Firewall: add TCPFlag, Frequency, TCPSyn, ICMPTypeMatch, NatDestination\n    Thanks,
  Félix Sipma.\n  * Network: Filter out characters not allowed in interfaces.d files.\n
  \   Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Apt.upgrade: Run dpkg --configure -a first, to recover
  from\n    interrupted upgrades.\n  * Apt: Add safeupgrade.\n  * Force ssh, scp,
  and git commands to be run in the foreground.\n    Should fix intermittent hangs
  of propellor --spin.\n  * Avoid repeated re-building on systems such as FreeBSD
  where building\n    re-links the binary even when there are no changes.\n  * Locale.available:
  Run locale-gen, instead of dpkg-reconfigure locales,\n    which modified the locale.gen
  file and sometimes caused the property to\n    need to make changes every time.\n
  \ * Speed up propellor's build of itself, by asking cabal to only build\n    the
  propellor-config binary and not all the libraries.\n  * Tor.named: Fix bug that
  sometimes caused the property to fail the first\n    time, though retrying succeeded.\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 24 Mar 2016 14:53:31 -0400\n\npropellor (2.16.0)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Obnam: Only let one backup job run at a time when
  a host has multiple\n    different backup properties, to avoid concurrent jobs fighting
  over\n    scarce resources (particularly memory). Other jobs block on a lock\n    file.\n
  \ * Removed references to a Debian derivative from code and documentation\n    because
  of an unfortunate trademark use policy.\n    http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/trademark_nonsense/\n
  \ * That included changing a data constructor to \"Buntish\", an API change.\n  *
  Firewall.rule: Now takes a Table parameter. (API change)\n  * Firewall: add InIFace/OutIFace
  Rules, add Source/Destination Rules,\n    add CustomTarget, and more improvements.\n
  \   Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Ssh.authorizedKey: Fix bug preventing it from working
  when the\n    authorized_keys file does not yet exist.\n  * Removed Ssh.unauthorizedKey
  and made Ssh.authorizedKey revertable.\n    (API change)\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Sat, 27 Feb 2016 13:31:57 -0400\n\npropellor (2.15.4) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Build /usr/src/propellor/propellor.git reproducibly,\n    which makes the whole
  Debian package build reproducibly.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n  * Obnam: To cause
  old generations to be forgotten, keepParam can be\n    passed to a backup property;
  this causes obnam forget to be run.\n  * Delete /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades.ucf-dist
  when\n    unattended-upgrades is installed, to work around #812380 which results\n
  \   in many warnings from apt, including in cron mails.\n  * Added Propellor.Property.LetsEncrypt\n
  \ * Apache.httpsVirtualHost: New property, setting up a https vhost\n    with the
  certificate automatically obtained using letsencrypt.\n  * Allow using combineProperties
  and propertyList with lists of\n    RevertableProperty.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Thu, 11 Feb 2016 12:49:10 -0400\n\npropellor (2.15.3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Added Git.bareRepoDefaultBranch property\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n  * Add
  missing Control.Applicative imports needed by older versions of ghc.\n\n -- Joey
  Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 12 Jan 2016 12:37:22 -0400\n\npropellor (2.15.2) unstable;
  urgency=medium\n\n  * Added GNUPGBIN environment variable or git.program git config\n
  \   to control the command run for gpg. Allows eg, GNUPGBIN=gpg2\n    Thanks, Félix
  Sipma.\n  * Bootstrap apt-get installs run with deconf noninteractive frontend.\n
  \ * spin --via: Avoid committing on relay host.\n  * Postfix: Add service property
  to enable/disable services in master.cf.\n  * Added Munin module, contributed by
  Jelmer Vernooij.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 03 Jan 2016 16:56:26 -0400\n\npropellor
  (2.15.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added git configs propellor.spin-branch
  and propellor.forbid-dirty-spin.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n  * Added User.systemAccountFor
  and User.systemAccountFor' properties.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Gpg.keyImported
  converted to not use a flag file and instead check\n    if gpg has the provided
  key already.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Clean build with ghc 7.10.\n  * Merged
  Utility changes from git-annex.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 19 Dec 2015
  16:43:09 -0400\n\npropellor (2.15.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Added UncheckedProperty
  type, along with unchecked to indicate a\n    Property needs its result checked,
  and checkResult and changesFile\n    to check for changes.\n  * Properties that
  run an arbitrary command, such as cmdProperty\n    and scriptProperty are converted
  to use UncheckedProperty, since\n    they cannot tell on their own if the command
  truely made a change or not.\n    (API Change)\n    Transition guide:\n    - When
  GHC complains about an UncheckedProperty, add:\n    \t`assume` MadeChange\n      (Since
  these properties used to always return MadeChange, that\n      change is always
  safe to make.)\n    - Or, if you know that the command should modifiy a file, use:\n
  \   \t`changesFile` filename\n  * The `trivial` combinator has been removed. (API
  change)\n    Instead, use:\n    \t`assume` NoChange\n    Or, better, use changesFile
  or checkResult to accurately report\n    when a property makes a change.\n  * A
  few properties have had their Result improved, for example\n    Apt.buldDep and
  Apt.autoRemove now check if a change was made or not.\n  * User.hasDesktopGroups
  changed to avoid trying to add the user to\n    groups that don't exist.\n  * Added
  Postfix.saslPasswdSet.\n  * Added Propellor.Property.Locale.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton.\n
  \ * Added Propellor.Property.Fail2Ban.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 06
  Dec 2015 15:33:51 -0400\n\npropellor (2.14.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Add
  Propellor.Property.PropellorRepo.hasOriginUrl, an explicit way to\n    set the git
  repository url normally implicitly set when using --spin.\n  * Added Chroot.noServices
  property.\n  * DiskImage creation automatically uses Chroot.noServices.\n  * Removed
  the (unused) dependency on quickcheck.\n  * DebianMirror: Added a DebianMirror type
  for configuration (API change)\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * DebianMirror: Add
  RsyncExtra to configuration.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Added Git.repoConfigured
  and Git.repoAcceptsNonFFs properties.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Added User.hasDesktopGroups
  property.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 24 Nov 2015 16:03:55 -0400\n\npropellor
  (2.13.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * RevertableProperty used to be assumed to
  contain info, but this is\n    now made explicit, with RevertableProperty HasInfo
  or\n    RevertableProperty NoInfo. (API change)\n    Transition guide:\n      -
  If you define a RevertableProperty, expect some type check\n        failures like:
  \"Expecting one more argument to ‘RevertableProperty’\".\n      - Change it to \"RevertableProperty
  NoInfo\"\n      - The compiler will then tell you if it needs \"HasInfo\" instead.\n
  \     - If you have code that uses the RevertableProperty constructor\n        that
  fails to type check, use the more powerful <!> operator\n        instead to create
  the RevertableProperty.\n  * Various property combinators that combined a RevertableProperty\n
  \   with a non-revertable property used to yield a RevertableProperty.\n    This
  was a bug, because the combined property could not be fully\n    reverted in many
  cases, and the result is now a non-revertable property.\n  * combineWith now takes
  an additional parameter to control how revert\n    actions are combined (API change).\n
  \ * Added Propellor.Property.Concurrent for concurrent properties.\n  * Made the
  execProcess exported by propellor, and everything built on it,\n    avoid scrambled
  output when run concurrently.\n  * Propellor now depends on STM and text.\n  * The
  cabal file now builds propellor with -O. While -O0 makes ghc\n    take less memory
  while building propellor, it can lead to bad memory\n    usage at runtime due to
  eg, disabled stream fusion.\n  * Add File.isCopyOf. Thanks, Per Olofsson.\n\n --

  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * The DiskImage module can now make bootable images
  using grub.\n  * Add a ChrootTarball chroot type, for using pre-built tarballs\n
  \   as chroots. Thanks, Ben Boeckel.\n  * HostName: Improve domain extraction code.\n
  \ * Added Mount.fstabbed property to generate /etc/fstab to replicate\n    current
  mounts.\n  * HostName: Improve domain extraction code.\n  * Add File.basedOn. Thanks,
  Per Olofsson.\n  * Changed how the operating system is provided to Chroot (API change).\n
  \   Where before debootstrapped and bootstrapped took a System parameter,\n    the
  os property should now be added to the Chroot.\n  * Follow-on change to Systemd.container,
  which now takes a System parameter.\n  * Generalized Property.check so it can be
  used with Propellor actions as\n    well as IO actions.\n  * Hostname.sane and Hostname.setTo
  can now safely be used as a property\n    of a chroot, and won't affect the hostname
  of the host system.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 23 Oct 2015 17:38:32
  -0400\n\npropellor (2.11.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Rewrote Propellor.Property.ControlHeir
  one more time, renaming it to\n    Propellor.Property.Conductor.\n  * Added Ssh
  properties to remove authorized_keys and known_hosts lines.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Wed, 21 Oct 2015 19:49:00 -0400\n\npropellor (2.10.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * The Propellor.Property.Spin added in the last release is replaced\n    with
  a very different Propellor.Property.ControlHeir.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Tue, 20 Oct 2015 21:29:12 -0400\n\npropellor (2.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Added basic Uwsgi module, maintained by Félix Sipma.\n  * Add Apt.hasForeignArch.
  Thanks, Per Olofsson.\n  * Improved documentation, particularly of the Propellor
  module.\n  * The Propellor module no longer exports many of the things it used to,\n
  \   being now focused on only what's needed to write config.hs.\n    Use Propellor.Base
  to get all the things exported by Propellor before.\n    (API change)\n  * Some
  renaming of instance methods, and moving of functions to more\n    appropriate modules.
  (API change)\n  * Added File.isSymlinkedTo. Thanks, Per Olofsson.\n  * fileProperty,
  and properties derived from it now write the new\n    file content via origfile.propellor-new~,
  instead of to a randomly named\n    temp file. This allows them to clean up any
  temp file that may have\n    been left by an interrupted run of propellor.\n  *
  Added Propellor.Property.Spin, which can be used to make a host be a\n    controller
  of other hosts, which will automatically spin them each time\n    propellor is run.\n
  \ * Ssh.keyImported is replaced with Ssh.userKeys. (API change)\n    The new property
  only gets the private key from the privdata; the\n    public key is provided as
  a parameter, and so is available as\n    Info that other properties can use.\n  *
  Ssh.keyImported' is renamed to Ssh.userKeyAt, and also changed\n    to only import
  the private key from the privdata. (API change)\n  * While Ssh.keyImported and Ssh.keyImported'
  avoided updating existing\n    keys, the new Ssh.userKeys and Ssh.userKeyAt properties
  will\n    always update out of date key files.\n  * Ssh.pubKey renamed to Ssh.hostPubKey.
  (API change)\n  * Added --unset-unused \n  * Fix typo: propigate → propagate. Thanks,
  Felix Gruber.\n    (A minor API change)\n  * Chroot: Converted to use a ChrootBootstrapper
  type class, so\n    other ways to bootstrap chroots can easily be added in separate\n
  \   modules. (API change)\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 20 Oct 2015 15:43:12
  -0400\n\npropellor (2.8.1) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Guard against power loss
  etc when building propellor, by updating\n    the executable atomically.\n  * Added
  Logcheck module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooij.\n  * Added Kerberos module, contributed
  by Jelmer Vernooij.\n  * Privdata that uses HostContext inside a container will
  now have the\n    name of the container as its context, rather than the name of\n
  \   the host(s) where the container is used. This allows eg, having different\n
  \   passwords for a user in different containers. Note that previously,\n    propellor
  would prompt using the container name as the context, but\n    not actually use
  privdata using that context; so this is a bug fix.\n  * Fix --add-key to not fail
  committing when no privdata file exists yet.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun,
  04 Oct 2015 13:54:59 -0400\n\npropellor (2.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  *
  Added Propellor.Property.Rsync.\n  * Convert Info to use Data.Dynamic, so properties
  can export and consume\n    info of any type that is Typeable and a Monoid, including
  data types\n    private to a module. (API change)\n    Thanks to Joachim Breitner
  for the idea.\n  * Improve propellor wrapper to better handle installation cloning\n
  \   the public propellor repo, by setting that repo to be upstream,\n    so propellor
  doesnt try to push to a read-only repo.\n  * Added DebianMirror module, contributed
  by Félix Sipma.\n  * Some hlint cleanups.\n    Thanks, Mario Lang\n  * Added Propellor.Property.Unbound
  for the caching DNS server.\n    Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * Added PTR to Dns.Record.
  While this is ignored by\n    Propellor.Property.Dns for now, since reverse DNS
  setup is not\n    implemented there yet, it can be used in other places, eg Unbound.\n
  \   Thanks, Félix Sipma.\n  * PrivData converted to newtype (API change).\n  * Stopped
  stripping trailing newlines when setting PrivData;\n    this was previously done
  to avoid mistakes when pasting eg passwords\n    with an unwanted newline. Instead,
  PrivData consumers should use either\n    privDataLines or privDataVal, to extract
  respectively lines or a\n    value (without internal newlines) from PrivData.\n
  \ * Allow storing arbitrary ByteStrings in PrivData, extracted using\n    privDataByteString.\n
  \ * Added Aiccu module, contributed by Jelmer Vernooĳ.\n  * Added --rm-key.\n\n

  HasInfo.\n    This was done to make sure that ensureProperty is only used on\n    properties

  \"Property NoInfo\" or \"Property HasInfo\"\n      (The compiler can tell you if
  you got it wrong!)\n    - To construct a RevertableProperty, it is useful to use
  the new\n      (<!>) operator\n    - Constructing a list of properties can be problimatic,
  since\n      Property NoInto and Property HasInfo are different types and cannot\n
  \     appear in the same list. To deal with this, \"props\" has been added,\n      and
  can built up a list of properties of different types,\n      using the same (&)

description: ! "[Propellor](https://propellor.branchable.com/) is a\nconfiguration
  management system using Haskell and Git.\nEach system has a list of properties,
  which Propellor ensures\nare satisfied.\n[Linux](http://propellor.branchable.com/Linux/)
  and\n[FreeBSD](http://propellor.branchable.com/FreeBSD/) are supported.\n\nPropellor
  is configured via a git repository, which typically lives\nin `~/.propellor/` on
  your development machine. Propellor clones the\nrepository to each host it manages,
  in a \n[secure](http://propellor.branchable.com/security/) way. See \n[components](http://propellor.branchable.com/components/)\nfor
  details.\n\nProperties are defined using Haskell. Edit `~/.propellor/config.hs`\nto
  get started. There is fairly complete \n[API documentation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/),\nwhich
  includes many built-in Properties for dealing with\n[Apt](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Apt.html)\nand\n[Apache](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Apache.html)\n,\n[Cron](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Cron.html)\nand\n[Commands](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Cmd.html)\n,\n[Dns](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Dns.html)\nand\n[Docker](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/propellor/docs/Propellor-Property-Docker.html),
  etc.\n\nThere is no special language as used in puppet, chef, ansible, etc.. just\nthe
  full power of Haskell. Hopefully that power can be put to good use in\nmaking declarative
  properties that are powerful, nicely idempotent, and\neasy to adapt to a system's
  special needs!\n\nIf using Haskell to configure Propellor seems intimidating,\nsee
  [configuration for the Haskell newbie](https://propellor.branchable.com/haskell_newbie/).\n\n##
  quick start\n\n1. Get propellor installed on your development machine (ie, laptop).\n
  \    `cabal install propellor`\n          or\n     `apt-get install propellor`\n2.
  Run `propellor --init` ; this will set up a `~/.propellor/` git\n   repository for
  you.\n3. Edit `~/.propellor/config.hs`, and add a host you want to manage.\n   You
  can start by not adding any properties, or only a few.\n4. Run: `propellor --spin
  $HOST`\n5. Now you have a simple propellor deployment to a host. Continue editing\n
  \  `~/.propellor/config.hs` to further configure the host, add more hosts\n   etc,
  and re-run `propellor --spin $HOST` after each change.  \n6. Once you have a lot
  of hosts, and running `propellor --spin HOST` for\n   each host becomes tiresome,
  you can\n   [automate that](http://propellor.branchable.com/automated_spins/).\n7.
  Write some neat new properties and send patches!\n"

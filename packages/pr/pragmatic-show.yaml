description: ! 'The standard ''Show'' class is handy for quickly viewing any Haskell

  values without having to think about formatting. However, it often

  produces needlessly clunky string representations, which are difficult

  to parse by eye. This package offers a drop-in replacement which

  attempts to keep the representation as short as possible.'

description: ! 'Pretty printing class similar to Show, based on the HughesPJ

  pretty printing library.  Provides the pretty printing class

  and instances for the Prelude types.  This upload replaces the

  old pretty-class package (which I believe nobody is using) with

  a copy of Lennart''s prettyclass package with a small change to

  its Char instance.'

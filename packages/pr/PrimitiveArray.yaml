description: ! 'This library provides efficient multidimensional arrays. Import

  @Data.PrimitiveArray@ for indices, lenses, and arrays.


  For ADPfusion users, the library also provides the machinary to

  fill tables in the correct order required by usual CYK-style

  parsers, or regular grammars (used e.g. in alignment

  algorithms). This means that unless your grammar require a

  strange order in which parsing is to be performed, it will

  mostly "just work".


  In general all operations are (highly) unsafe, no

  bounds-checking or other sanity-checking is performed.

  Operations are aimed toward efficiency as much as possible.'

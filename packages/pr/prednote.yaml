description: ! '# prednote


  prednote helps you build a tree of predicates that you can apply to

  a list of items.  It was written for Penny:


  http://www.github.com/massysett/penny


  but I also find it useful for dapi:


  http://www.github.com/massysett/dapi


  and so you might find it useful too.


  prednote is on Github:


  http://www.github.com/massysett/prednote


  and Hackage:


  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/prednote


  ## Test results


  You can view the results of building and testing on Travis by clicking

  the button below:


  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/massysett/prednote.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/massysett/prednote)


  If you have trouble building prednote due to dependency issues, try

  looking at the previous test results, as they will show you package

  versions that were used to build prednote successfully.


  ## Something similar


  See also rematch:


  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rematch


  which is apparently based on a Java library called hamcrest.

description: ! 'Propane is a system for synthesizing images and animations, in the
  spirit

  of Pan (<http://conal.net/Pan/>) and many other projects.  The core idea is

  that an image is a function assigning a colour to each point in the plane.

  Similarly, an animation assigns an image to each point in time.  Haskell''s

  tools for functional and declarative programming can be used directly on

  images and animations.


  Several examples are provided, in the @examples/@ directory.


  Propane uses the Repa array library.  This means that Propane automatically

  uses multiple CPU cores for rendering, provided the program is compiled and

  run with threads enabled.  That said, the implementation has not yet been

  optimized for speed.


  Propane is a modest toy right now, but there are vague plans to make it

  do fancy things.  Please contact the author with suggestions or code!'

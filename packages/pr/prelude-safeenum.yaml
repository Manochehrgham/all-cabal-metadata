description: ! 'A redefinition of the Prelude''s Enum class in order to render

  it safe. That is, the Haskell Language Report defines pred,

  succ, fromEnum, and toEnum to be partial functions when the

  type is Bounded, but this is unacceptable. We define a new

  type-class hierarchy for enumeration which is safe and also

  generalizes to cover types which can only be enumerated in one

  direction.'

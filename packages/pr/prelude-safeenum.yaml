description: ! "prelude-safeenum\n================\n\nThis is a very simple package
  and should be easy to install. You\nshould be able to use any of the following standard
  methods to\ninstall it.\n\n    -- With cabal-install and without the source:\n    $>
  cabal install prelude-safeenum\n    \n    -- With cabal-install and with the source
  already:\n    $> cd prelude-safeenum\n    $> cabal install\n    \n    -- Without
  cabal-install, but with the source already:\n    $> cd prelude-safeenum\n    $>
  runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build\n    $> runhaskell
  Setup.hs test\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source\n    $> runhaskell
  Setup.hs copy\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register\n\nThe test step is optional
  and currently does nothing. The Haddock\nstep is also optional.\n\n\nPortability\n===========\n\nAn
  attempt has been made to keep this library portable; however,\nit does rely on a
  few language extensions. All the required language\nextensions are:\n\n    CPP\n
  \   GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving\n    MagicHash    -- only for GHC\n    Trustworthy
  \ -- only for GHC >= 7.1\n\nThe GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving extension is used for
  brevity in\nData.Number.CalkinWilf. If you'd like to use this package with a\ncompiler
  that does not support that extension, contact the maintainer\nand it can be removed.\n\nThis
  package is only \"Trustworthy\" rather than \"Safe\" for two\nreasons: (1) Data.Number.CalkinWilf
  uses GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving,\nand (2) Prelude.SafeEnum imports GHC.Exts for
  build/foldr fusion\nand for the Char instances.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------

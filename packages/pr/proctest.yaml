description: ! 'An IO library for testing interactive command line programs


  Proctest aims to simplify interacting with and testing

  terminal programs, providing convenience functions

  for starting programs and reading their output.


  All blocking operations support timeouts so that misbehaving

  programs cannot block your test pipeline.

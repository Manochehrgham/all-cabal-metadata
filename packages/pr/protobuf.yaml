description: ! 'Google Protocol Buffers via GHC.Generics.


  Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet extensible
  format.

  Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and file
  formats.


  This library supports a useful subset of Google Protocol Buffers message specifications

  in a Haskell. No preprocessor or additional build steps are required for message
  encoding and decoding.


  Record specifications are built by defining records with specially defined fields
  that

  capture most of the Protocol Buffers specification language.

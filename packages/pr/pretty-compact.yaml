description: ! 'This package contains a pretty-printing library, a set of API''s

  that provides a way to easily print out text in a consistent

  format of your choosing. This is useful for compilers and related

  tools.


  This library produces more compact outputs than both

  Wadler-Leijen or Hughes-PJ algorithms, at the expense of computational ressources.

  The API is the same as Wadler-Leijen''s.'

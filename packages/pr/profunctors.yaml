synopsis: Profunctors
changelog: ! "4.4.1\n-------\n* Using `SafeHaskell`, GHC 7.8+ `Data.Profunctor.Unsafe`
  now infers as `Trustworthy` and\n  many more modules now infer as `Safe`.\n* We
  now build warning-free on GHC 7.10.0.20150307\n\n4.4\n-----\n* Added `Coercible`
  constraint to (#.) and (.#) when building with GHC 7.8\n* `Strong` is now a superclass
  of `Representable`\n* Updated the URL of the \"Arrows are Strong Monads\" paper.
  The old URL is now a dead link.\n\n4.3.2\n-----\n* Added some missing instances
  for `UpStar` and `DownStar`.\n\n4.3\n---\n* Removed the non law-abiding instance
  for `Closed (Forget r)`\n* `Forget` is `Representable`\n* MINIMAL pragmas\n\n4.2.0.1\n-------\n*
  Avoided using 'type' in the export list, as that doesn't work on 7.4.\n\n4.2\n---\n*
  Renamed `-|` to `ProfunctorAdjunction` because GHC 7.4 still exists in the wild.\n*
  Renamed `-/->` to `:->` for the same reason. Also the former was confusing as they
  conflated profunctor homomorphisms and profunctors themselves.\n\n4.1\n---\n* Flipped
  the order of 'Procompose'\n* Added the notion of Monads and Comonads on the category
  of profunctors.\n* Added 'Cayley' which takes normal Haskell Monads and Comonads
  to a 'ProfunctorMonad' and 'ProfunctorComonad' respectively. Cayley is also known
  as the 'static arrow' construction\n* Added 'Closed' which is adjoint to 'Strong'.\n*
  Added 'Closure' which freely adjoins 'Closed' to any 'Profunctor'.\n* Added 'Tambara'
  which freely adjoins 'Strong' to any 'Profunctor'.\n* Added 'Cotambara' which freely
  adjoins 'Choice' to any 'Profunctor'.\n* Under the new 'Procompose' the old 'Rift'
  is now 'Ran', and the old 'Lift' was misnamed. It is now 'Rift'\n\n4.0.3\n-----\n*
  Added `Data.Profunctor.Lift` containing the left Kan lift of a profunctor.\n\n4.0.2\n-----\n*
  Added `assoc` to `Data.Profunctor.Composition` so that we have all 3 associators.\n\n4.0\n---\n*
  Merged the contents of `profunctor-extras` into `profunctors`.\n\n3.3\n---\n* Added
  `instance Choice (Upstar f)` and introduced `Forget`.\n\n3.2\n---\n* Renamed `Lenticular`
  and `Prismatic` to `Strong` and `Choice`, and restructured them.\n\n3.1.3\n-----\n*
  Removed upper bounds on my own intra-package dependencies\n\n3.1.1\n-----\n* Added
  Documentation!\n* Added `Lenticular` and `Prismatic` Profunctors\n\n3.1\n---\n*
  instance Profunctor Tagged\n\n3.0\n---\n* Updated version number to match the rest
  of my libraries\n"

synopsis: Simple bindings to Qhull, a library for computing convex hulls
changelog: ''

description: ! 'Simple bindings to Qhull, a C library (<http://qhull.org>) for computing
  convex hulls. Currently, only convex hull computation in the @Qt@ and/or @Qx@ modes
  is supported.


  The Qhull library itself is not included, as I consider it a dependency. Cabal''s
  @--extra-include-dirs@ and @--extra-lib-dirs@ can be used if the Qhull headers and
  shared objects are not in GCC''s search path.


  Hackage probably fails to build the Haddock documentation since Qhull itself is
  missing. The

  documentation can be viewed at <http://nonempty.org/software/haskell-qhull-simple/>.


  Qhull itself is copyright 1992-2012 C. B. Arber and The Geometry Center, University
  of Minnesota.


  Notes:


  * The current version has only been tested /very lightly/, and only with version
  2009.1 of Qhull.


  * The API will probably change drastically in future versions, especially to be
  more flexible with regards to input data formats.


  Changes in version 0.1:


  * Initial release.'

description: ! 'The MineCraft edition for Raspberry PI comes with a Java and

  Python API. See "Network.MineCraft.Pi.Client" for a basic

  example.


  This is a *very* basic, and *incomplete* Haskell version. I

  fully expect everything to change in later versions.


  A number of very simple examples are included in the examples/ directory,

  as well as a program that lets you interact with MineCraft directly.


  Please see the TODO.md file in the source code for an incomplete

  list of possible changes, and the CHANGELOG file for changes

  in the module.'

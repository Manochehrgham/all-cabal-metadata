description: ! 'Common types for implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.


  An instance of an MCMC problem can be characterized by the following:


  * A /target distribution/ over some parameter space


  * A /parameter space/ for a Markov chain to wander over


  * A /transition operator/ to drive the Markov chain


  /mcmc-types/ provides the suitably-general ''Target'', ''Chain'', and

  ''Transition'' types for representing these things respectively.'

description: ! 'This is a RNA secondary structure prediction tool based on the

  idea of combining small motifs, called nucleotide cyclic motifs

  (NCMs). The algorithm implemented here and described in

  "The MC-Fold and MC-Sym pipeline infers RNA structure from

  sequence data",


  Nature 2008, 452(7183):51-55. <http://www.major.iric.ca/MC-Fold/>



  This program uses the same database as MC-Fold (which has

  exponential run-time) and aims to be able to produce the same

  results.


  The underlying grammar of our implementation is unambiguous and

  allows the complete evaluation of all structures within an

  energy band above the ground state, presenting each unique

  structure just once. Alternatively, the grammar allows

  partition function calculations.


  Current status:


  * comparable prediction accuracy on sequences (compared with MC-Fold)


  * possibility to use sparse data correction


  * handles non-ACGU nucleotides gracefully


  * suboptimals: return all structures within an energy band above the ground state


  * constraint folding (fill partial structures)


  Todo:


  * Boltzmann likelihood calculations


  * pseudoknot calculations (currently aiming for a pknotsRG-like algorithm)'

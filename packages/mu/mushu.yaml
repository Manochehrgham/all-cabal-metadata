description: ! "Mushu [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elaye/mushu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elaye/mushu)\n=====\n\nMushu
  is a minimalist MPD client with a Text User Interface (TUI) focused on ease of use.\nIts
  main feature is an incremental fuzzy finder for the music library.\nThe interface
  is largely inspired by [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/arybczak/ncmpcpp).\n\n![Screenshot](screenshot.png?raw=true
  \"Mushu screenshot\")\n\nThis client was made to fit my needs so it may not fit
  yours.\nA lot of MPD features are not implemented.\n\nDependencies\n--------------\n\n`libncurses5-dev`\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nMushu
  is available on stack.\n\n  `stack install mushu`\n\nIf you don't have `stack` please
  install it following instructions [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).\n\nWhy
  another MPD client?\n-----------------------\n\nI used [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/arybczak/ncmpcpp)
  for quite some time and realised that I was always doing the same thing with it:
  search for music -> add to playlist and play.\nI was not entirely satisfied with
  the search in ncmpcpp so I decided to make my own.\nAlso, ncmpcpp as way too many
  features that I don't use.\n\nThe aim is to keep the number of features to a minimum
  without being unusable.\n\nI also wanted to develop a real world haskell project
  and this seemed like a good opportunity.\n\nTODO\n----\n\n - [ ] Add config file
  (mainly to be able to choose a different server than `localhost:6600` for MPD)\n
  - [ ] Add MPD error handling and show error in a notification widget\n - [ ] Add
  MPD playback modes handling\n - UI\n   - [ ] Improve help screen\n   - [ ] Add top
  / bottom list keybindings (`G` and `g`)\n   - [ ] Add delete from playlist keybinding
  (`d` or `x`?)\n - [ ] Fix all the bugs and refactor!\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nContributions
  are very welcome. However please open an issue before developing anything too big
  so we can discuss it, I'd hate to have wasted your time if the Pull Request you
  made can't be merged.\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.\nIf
  you want an overview of the app, check out [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md).\n\n"

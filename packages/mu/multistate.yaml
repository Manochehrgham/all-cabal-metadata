description: ! 'When using multiple Read/Write/State transformers in the same monad
  stack,

  it becomes necessary to lift the operations in order to affect a specific

  transformer.

  Using heterogenous lists (and all kinds of GHC extensions magic),

  this package provides transformers that remove that necessity:

  MultiReaderT/MultiWriterT/MultiStateT can contain a heterogenous list of

  values.


  See the <https://github.com/lspitzner/multistate README> for

  a longer description.'

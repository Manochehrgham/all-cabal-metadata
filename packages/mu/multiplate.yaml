description: ! 'Multiplate is an alternative extension of the Uniplate/Compos core
  library

  to support mutally recursive

  datatypes in a way that is as powerful as Compos, as easy to use as Biplate, and

  more portable than both of them.

  Multiplate does not require GADTs and does not require multi-parameter type classes.

  It only requires rank 3 polymorphism.'

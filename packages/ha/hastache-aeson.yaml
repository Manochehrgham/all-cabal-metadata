description: ! "hastache-aeson\n==============\n\n* Lets you pass [aeson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson)
  `Value` as `MuContext` to [hastache](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hastache)\n*
  Since [yaml](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yaml) is API-compatible to `aeson`,
  you can also render `yaml` `Value`s.\n\nExample\n-------\n\n```haskell\n{-# LANGUAGE
  OverloadedStrings #-}\n\nimport qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as BS\nimport qualified
  Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as LBS\n\nimport Control.Monad\nimport Data.Maybe (fromJust)\n\nimport
  Data.Yaml\nimport Text.Hastache\nimport Text.Hastache.Aeson (jsonValueContext)\n\nevent
  = BS.readFile \"event.yaml\"\ntemplate = BS.readFile \"index.mustache\"\n\nrender
  template value = hastacheStr defaultConfig template (jsonValueContext value)\n\nmain
  = do\n    value <- liftM (fromJust . decode) event :: IO Value\n    template' <-
  template\n    render template' value >>= LBS.putStrLn\n```\n\nBSD3 License\n------------\n\n```\nCopyright

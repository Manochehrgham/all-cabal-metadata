description: ! '@handsy@ is a small library mainly for applications which should make
  some

  operations on remote machines by SSH. It currently provides you:


  * A DSL describing basic system operations(''command'', ''readFile'', ''writeFile''
  etc.)


  * Two interpreters for running this DSL locally or via SSH(''run'' and ''runRemote'')


  * Some utility functions for common commands(''os'', ''mkTemp'' etc.)


  If you''re looking for a shell scripting alternative, look at @turtle@, @shelly@
  or

  @shellmate@ packages. @handsy@ is mostly relevant for the ability to apply simple

  commands remotely.'

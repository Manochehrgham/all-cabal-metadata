description: ! "# Hackager\n\nHackager is a tool to compile all of the Haskell Hackage
  package\nrepository. This is useful for testing Haskell compilers.\n\n## Using\nHackager
  consists of one tool that supports multiple commands.\n\n''hackager'' is invoked
  with the following options:\n\n~~~~ {.sh}\n$ usage: hackager [--version] [--help]
  <command> [<args>]\n\nThe valid hackager commands are:\n    record    Try building
  all of hackage and record results\n    report    Compare two 'record' runs and display
  results\n\nSee 'hackager help <command>' for more information on a specific command\n~~~~\n\n''hackager
  record'' has the following options:\n\n~~~~ {.sh}\nusage: hackager record -o NAME
  [-c CABAL] [-g GHC] [-p GHC-PKG] [-d DEP-FLAGS]\n                      [-f PKG-FLAGS]
  [-n THREADS] [PKGS...]\n\n    NAME         A name by which the results of this hackager
  run will\n                 be referred, e.g. \\\"ghc-7.6.1\\\"\n    CABAL        The
  path to the cabal program to use\n    GHC          The path to the ghc program to
  use\n    GHC-PKG      The path to the ghc-pkg program to use\n    DEP-FLAGS    The
  flags to use when compiling dependencies of a package\n                 e.g. \\\"--ghc-option=-XFoo\\\"\n
  \   PKG-FLAGS    The flags to use when compiling a package\n                 e.g.
  \\\"--ghc-option=-XBar\\\"\n    THREADS      Number of threads to use to build in
  parallel\n    PKGS         A list of packages to build. If not specified all of\n
  \                hackage is built\n~~~~\n\nFor example, here is a run with GHC,
  no special options and using 4\nthreads (note that this generally takes a long time,
  i.e. a few days):\n\n~~~ {.sh}\n$ hackager record -o normal -n 4\n~~~~\n\nThen another
  run, this time using ''-XAlternativeLayoutRule'' to\ncompile each package (but not
  the build dependencies of the package):\n\n~~~~ {.sh}\n$ hackager record -o altern
  -f \"--ghc-option=-XAlternativeLayoutRule\" -n 4\n~~~~\n\nAnd finally a comparison
  of the results:\n\n~~~~ {.sh}\n$ hackager report normal altern\n\n                            normal\n
  \                        Buildable Build failed Deps failed Not tried\naltern Buildable
  \         628            0           0         0\n       Build failed        73
  \         215           0         0\n       Deps failed          0            0
  \        170         0\n       Not tried            0            0           0         0\n~~~~\n\nThese
  results mean that 73 packages became unbuildable when the\nalternative layout rule
  is used.\n\n## Caution\n\nHackager can cause arbitrary code to run on your machine.
  For example:\n * TemplateHaskell is run at compile time and can execute arbitrary\n
  \  code\n * Package configure scripts will be run\n * Custom Setup.hs programs will
  be run\n\n"

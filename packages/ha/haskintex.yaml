description: ! 'The /haskintex/ (Haskell in LaTeX) program is a tool that reads a
  LaTeX file and evaluates Haskell expressions contained

  in some specific commands and environments. It allows you to define your own functions,
  use any GHC Haskell language

  extension and, in brief, anything you can do within Haskell.

  Additionally, it is possible to include expressions of ''LaTeX'' type (see /HaTeX/
  package) and render them as LaTeX code.

  You can freely add any Haskell code you need, and make this code appear /optionally/
  in the LaTeX output. It is a tiny program,

  and therefore, easy to understand, use and predict.'

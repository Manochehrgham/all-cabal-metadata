description: ! 'High Performance Neural Network in Haskell


  Provides fast training algorithms using

  hmatrix''s bindings to GSL and custom bindings

  to the liblbfgs C-library


  Supported training algorithms: Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient, BFGS, LBFGS


  - Users should focus on "AI.Model" for most usages (classification / regression)


  - Other modules are provided for user expansion if needed

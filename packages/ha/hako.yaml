description: ! 'A quasi-quote based HTML template library with a simplistic

  approach, Hako borrows its philosophy from Mako, a popular

  Python template library. The idea is that the template

  mechanism itself should be kept simple, while exposing the

  full expressivity of Haskell itself inside the templates.

  At the same time, any value interpolated into a template gets

  HTML-encoded by default, but you can override this behavior

  by providing your own instances of the ''ToHtml'' typeclass.'

description: ! 'This package contains bindings to the Wayland library, which is used
  to interface display devices, drawable clients, and window managers.


  Wayland exposes a "fixed" set of functions, and additionally generates a part of
  its API from a "protocol" file.

  This package locates that protocol file using pkg-config.


  If you want to interface with other protocols (such as Weston''s), refer to the
  readme for instructions.'

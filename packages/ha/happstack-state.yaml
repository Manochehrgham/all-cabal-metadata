description: Unplug your machine and restart and have your app recover to exactly
  where it left off. Happstack-State spares you the need to deal with all the marshalling,
  consistency, and configuration headache that you would have if you used an external
  DBMS for this purpose. Its component model makes it easy to compose big applications
  from smaller reliable parts. Use event subscription to trigger IO actions and support
  comet-style or irc-bot applications.

description: ! 'This library was developed in the context of a programming methodology
  course for

  undergraduate students, and as a consequence, it was defined mainly for educational
  purposes.

  Indeed, it provides a clear, efficient and concise way to define, to understand

  and to manipulate regular languages in Haskell. Furthermore, the construction

  of the complete library has been proposed as assignment projects to the students

  following the course.  HaLeX is now being used to support this course.'

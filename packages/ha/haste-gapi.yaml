description: ! 'This is a library to make use of the Google API Client

  Library for JavasScript in a Haskell environment!

  The library works by wrapping login and giving you a

  fancy type to perform your requests in. This will ease

  chained requests that would give large amounts of clutter

  in JavaScript, while giving you a better ability to

  handle errors.

  Your HTML doesn''t even need to load the GAPI library

  itself, Haste-GAPI handles that for you!'

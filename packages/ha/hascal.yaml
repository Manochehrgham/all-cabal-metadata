description: ! 'Hascal is both a simple but extendable calculator library for

  Haskell as well as a command-line program using this library.


  Hascal supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,

  exponentiation, and logarithm, while it''s easy to add custom

  operators.


  Hascal also supports complex numbers. Hascal can work at an

  arbitrary precision. However, Hascal does not support

  parenthesis.'

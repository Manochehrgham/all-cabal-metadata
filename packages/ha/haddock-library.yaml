description: ! 'Haddock is a documentation-generation tool for Haskell

  libraries. These modules expose some functionality of it

  without pulling in the GHC dependency. Please note that the

  API is likely to change so specify upper bounds in your

  project if you can''t release often. For interacting with Haddock

  itself, see the ‘haddock’ package.'

description: ! 'Haskell XMPP (eXtensible Message Passing Protocol, a.k.a. Jabber)
  library


  Unlike package network-protocol-xmpp, which uses libxml-sax, this library uses HaXml
  and supports MUC.

  However, MUC support of the moment is worse than that in package XMPP.


  This library make extensive use of STM and threads to simplify writing message-handling
  code.'

description: The motivating use case for this is testing packages with newer versions
  of GHC. In this case, upper bounds on base, process, and a few other packages will
  often prevent compilation. This proxy will allow you to strip those upper bounds
  and proceed with compilation. In the future, other features may be added as well,
  such as package replacement.

  Hapistrano makes it easy to reliably deploy Haskell applications

  to a server.


  Following popular libraries like Ruby''s <http://capistranorb.com/

  Capistrano>, Hapistrano does the work of building the application

  with dependencies into a distinct folder, and then atomically moves

  a symlink to the latest complete build.


  This allows for atomic switchovers to new application code after the

  build is complete. Rollback is even simpler, since Hapistrano can

  just point the `current` symlink to the previous release.


  See <https://github.com/stackbuilders/hapistrano the project readme on GitHub>

  for more information.

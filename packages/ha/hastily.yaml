description: ! "### Hastily - A downloader of subtitles\n\nFinding the right subtitle
  for a movie file can be a frustrating experience if the movie file name does not
  have a unique release name, or there is no subtitle available that is specifically
  made\nfor the release/file you have in your possession. In such cases, you often
  have to resort to trial and error method. And there is no guarantee that among the
  15 or 20 subtitles available, one them will\nmatch the movie file you have. \n\nHastily
  is a program to help you in such cases. The way it works is simple.\n\n1. You invoke
  Hastily passing a partial movie name as an argument.\n2. Hastily will search the
  and provide you with a list of movie names that contains the search key that you
  passed. You can select the correct movie from that list.\n3. Hastily will search
  and find all the available subtitles for that movie.\n4. It will then extract and
  scan the subtitle files and find a dialogue that does not repeat in the same subtitle
  file and also appears in the most of the downloaded subtitles.\n5. It will then
  print out the time when that particular dialogue appears in all of the downloaded
  subtitles.\n\nYou have to find out when that particular dialogue appears in your
  movie file. Use this time and the list printed out by Hastily to find the best matching
  subtitle among those.\n\nRight now Hastily uses OMDB API to search for the movies
  and opensubtitles.org to search and download subtitles. And right now it will only
  process .srt files.\n\nHave fun!"

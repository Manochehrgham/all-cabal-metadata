description: ! "HarmTrace (Harmony Analysis and Retrieval of Music with Type-level
  \r\nRepresentations of Abstract Chords Entities) is a system for automatic harmony
  \r\nanalysis of music. It takes a sequence of chords as input and produces a harmony
  \r\nanalysis, which can be visualised as a tree. \r\n\r\nMusic theory has been essential
  in composing and performing music for centuries. \r\nWithin Western tonal music,
  from the early Baroque on to modern-day jazz and pop \r\nmusic, the function of
  chords within a chord sequence can be explained by \r\nharmony theory. Although
  Western tonal harmony theory is a thoroughly studied \r\narea, formalising this
  theory is a hard problem. \r\n\r\nWith HarmTrace we have developed a formalisation
  of the rules of tonal harmony \r\nas a Haskell (generalized) algebraic datatype.
  Given a sequence of chord labels, \r\nthe harmonic function of a chord in its tonal
  context is automatically derived. \r\nFor this, we use several advanced functional
  programming techniques, such as \r\ntype-level computations, datatype-generic programming,
  and error-correcting \r\nparsers. Our functional model of harmony offers various
  benefits: it can be used \r\nto define harmonic similarity measures and facilitate
  music retrieval, or it can \r\nhelp musicologists in batch-analysing large corpora
  of digitised scores, for \r\ninstance. \r\n\r\nMore information about HarmTrace,
  including how to use and example output, is\r\navailable on its webpage: http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/GenericProgramming/HarmTrace\r\n"

description: ! 'Haskeline provides all of its functionality within the scope of a
  monad transformer.

  This module adds two pieces to this:


  * Introduced here is a type-class which defines the operations

  supported by the Haskeline monad transformer - MonadHaskeline


  * A newtype wrapper around Haskeline''s InputT, called

  HaskelineT. Sadly, InputT defines ints own instance of the

  mtl MonadState, which is no good for folks wanting to use

  InputT in an existing monad transformer stack.


  HaskelineT also has an instance of MonadState, but it merely

  lifts the functions further in the transformer stack.


  Large portions of the Haskeline functionality are re-exported

  here for convinience.


  Note on build-dependencies: If you''ve succesfully built this with

  any packages other than the ones noted, please let me know.'

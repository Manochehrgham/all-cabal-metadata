  /EXAMPLE USAGE/


  > $ haskell-docs hSetBuffering

  > Package: base

  > Module: GHC.IO.Handle

  > hSetBuffering :: Handle -> BufferMode -> IO ()

  > Computation hSetBuffering `hdl mode` sets the mode of buffering for

  >  handle `hdl` on subsequent reads and writes.


  /INSTALLATION/


  You should ensure that you have


  > documentation: True


  in your .cabal/config so that the necessary

  .haddock files are generated.


  Haddock is very sensitive to the GHC version. This program tries not to be. If

  you cannot install this package due to a version problem, open a Github issue.

  If the versions match up but the build fails, open a Github issue. Neither

  case should arise.


  /USING WITH GHCI/


  > > :def doc \input -> return (":!haskell-docs " ++ input)

  > > :doc getContents

  > The getContents operation returns all user input as a single string,

  >  which is read lazily as it is needed

  >  (same as hGetContents stdin).


  Add the above :def to your user .ghci to have it on start-up.

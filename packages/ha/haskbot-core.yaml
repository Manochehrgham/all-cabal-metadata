description: ! 'Haskbot melds together the Slack /slash command/ and /incoming/ API

  integrations to create an easily-extensible platform for adding your own

  custom /slash commands/ with arbitrary responses to your team''s Slack

  service.


  Sure, Hubot exists, but when I desire custom chatbot functionality, I''d rather

  write nice, clean Haskell than clunky Javascript any day of the week.'

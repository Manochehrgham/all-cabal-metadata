description: ! 'The Haskell Pdf Presenter ("hpdfp") is a tool for presenting PDF-based

  slide shows.  It has many features and niceties that make delivering

  a presentation easier.  For example, as a

  presenter, it is useful to see the next slide before it is shown to

  the audience as well as how much allotted time remains.


  There are a lot of features that may not be immediately obvious so

  please be sure to look at the documentation.

  For help with the command line, use the "--help" flag.

  For help with the GUI, press the "?" key when the program is running.

  The "README" contains a terse summary of all the features.


  For more information and example uses, please visit the project home page.'

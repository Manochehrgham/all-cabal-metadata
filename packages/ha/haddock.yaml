synopsis: A documentation-generation tool for Haskell libraries
changelog: ! "Changes in version 2.16.0\n\n * Experimental collapsible header support
  (#335)\n\n * Add support for markdown links and images\n\n * Allow an optional colon
  after the closing bracket of definition lists.\n   This is to disambiguate them
  from markdown links and will be require with a\n   future release.\n\n * Fix re-exports
  of built-in type families (#310)\n\n * Fix parsing of infix identifiers such as
  ``elem``.\n\n * Print missing docs by default and add --no-print-missing-docs\n\n
  * parser: now parses out some meta data too, breaking the API\n\n * parser: markdown
  syntax for images and URLs is now accepted:\n   <<foo>> style for images and <foo
  bar> style for links is now\n   considered deprecated. <foo> for links is still
  OK.\n\n * parser: add support for @since element: this is paragraph-level\n   element
  of the form ‘@since x.y.z’ where x.y.z is the version\n   number. The way it is
  rendered is subject to change.\n\n * properly render package ID (not package key)
  in index (#329)\n\n * links to source location of class instance definitions\n\n
  * Fix code blocks in presence of Windows line endings\n\n * Deal better with long
  synopsis lines (#151)\n\nChanges in version 2.15.0\n\n * Always read in prologue
  files as UTF8 (#286 and Cabal #1721)\n\n * parser: don't wrap headers in DocParagraph
  (#307)\n\n * parser: don't mangle append order for nested lists (pandoc #1346)\n\n
  * parser: preserve list ordering in certain scenarios (#313)\n\n * parser: update
  the attoparsec version used internally giving slight\n   parsing performance boost.\n\n
  * Move development to be against latest GHC release and not GHC HEAD.\n\n * Further
  split up the package to separate the executable from the\n   library, necessary
  by things like GHCJS. We now have\n   ‘haddock-library’ which are the parts that
  don't use GHC API,\n   ‘haddock-api’ which are (some of) the parts that do use GHC
  API and\n   ‘haddock’ which merely provides the executable.\n\n * Export few extra
  functions in the API.\n\n * Add compatibility with GHC 7.8.2.\n\n * Omit unnecessary
  ‘forall’s (#315 and #86)\n\n * Remove some files which were really old or did not
  belong in the\n   repository in the first place.\n\nChanges in version 2.14.3\n\n
  * Fix parsing of identifiers with ^ or ⋆ in them (#298)\n\n * Fix anchors (#308)\n\nChanges
  in version 2.14.2\n\n * Always drop --split-objs GHC flag for performance reasons
  (#292)\n\n * Print kind signatures GADTs (#85)\n\n * Drop single leading whitespace
  when reasonable from @-style blocks (#201)\n\n * Fix crashes associated with exporting
  data family record selectors (#294)\n\nChanges in version 2.14.1\n\n * Render *
  and -> with their UnicodeSyntax equivalents if -U is enabled\n\n * Display minimal
  complete definitions for type classes\n\n * Hide right hand side of TF instances
  with hidden names on the RHS\n\nChanges in version 2.14.0\n\n * Print entities with
  missing documentation (#258)\n\n * Print a warning message when given `-optghc`
  instead of `--optghc` (#5)\n\n * Add `--compatible-interface-versions` (#231)\n\n
  * Allow to generate latex documentation for FFI declarations (#247)\n\n * Add copyright
  and license information to generated documentation\n\n * Improved to Unicode support\n\n
  * Bold markup support\n\n * Nested paragraphs\n\n * Better escaping\n\n * Header
  markup\n\n * Parser should no longer fail to parse any markup\n\n * {-# OPTIONS_HADDOCK
  show-extensions #-} pragma will show the GHC extensions\n   enabled in the module.\n\n
  * Properly render License field (#271)\n\n * Print type/data family instances (for
  exported types only)\n\n * Fix display of poly-kinded type operators (#189)\n\n
  * PatternSynonyms support\n\n * Fix display of implicit parameters (#260)\n\n *
  Fix rendering of Contents when links are present (#276)\n\n * Fix documentation
  duplication on record fields (#195)\n\n * Add `--source-entity-line` for exact line
  links (eg. things defined\n   inside TH splices) (#79)\n\n * Display fixity information
  for names with nonstandard fixities\n\n * Bird tracks specified like \"> code\"
  no longer suffer from an extra leading\n   space in the code output\n\nChanges in
  version 2.13.2\n\n * Handle HsExplicitListTy in renamer (#213)\n\n * Allow haddock
  markup in deprecation messages\n\n * Export more types from Documentation.Haddock\n\n
  * Include everything that is required to run the test suite with the cabal\n   package
  (#230)\n\nChanges in version 2.13.1\n\n * Hide instances that are \"internal\" to
  a module\n\n * Add support for properties in documentation\n\n * Fix a bug with
  spurious superclass constraints\n\n * Fix and extend the Haddock API\n\nChanges
  in version 2.12.0\n\n * Labeled URLs (e.g <http://example.net/ some label>)\n\n
  * Improved memory usage (new dependency: deepseq)\n\nChanges in version 2.11.0\n\n
  * Show deprecation messages for identifiers\n\n * List identifiers declared on the

  \ * Fix a couple of smaller bugs\n\n  * The representation of DocName was changed
  in the library\n\n  * Add a flag --no-warnings for turning off warnings\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 2.0.0.0:\n\n  * The GHC API is used as the front-end\n\n  * Haddock now
  understands all syntax understood by GHC 6.8.2\n\n  * Haddock can generate documentation
  for some of the language extensions\n    in GHC 6.8.2\n\n  * Format of module attributes
  has changed. The only way of specifying\n    module attributes is via a new OPTIONS_HADDOCK

  to the search as you type (thanks to Neil Mitchell).\n\n  * Add a --ghc-pkg flag\n\n
  \ * Add a flag --allow-missing-html\n\n  * URL expansion for %%, %L, %{LINE}\n\n
  \ * added substitution %{FILE///c}\n\n  * Lexing of /.../ is now more like '...',
  in that a / character must\n    be matched by another / character on the same line,
  otherwise it\n    is treated as a literal '/'.  This removes a common source of\n
  \   accidental parse errors in documentation.\n\n  * Various bugs were fixed.\n\n
  \ * Cabal 1.2 is now required, and Haddock builds with GHC 6.8.x.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.8:\n\n  * Haddock has a Cabal build system, and will build on Windows
  without\n    Cygwin or MSYS.  GHC 6.4 or later is required.\n\n  * New options:
  --comments-base, --comments-module, --comments-entity\n    for generating links
  to pages (eg. wiki) for collecting user comments.\n\n  * New options: --source-base,
  --source-module, --source-entity\n    for generating links to source code.  Haddock
  now understands\n    {-# LINE #-} pragmas, which means it can figure out the correct\n
  \   name for the source file even if the file is preprocessed.\n\n  * Haddock generates
  output for populating the Hoogle search engine.\n\n  * New markup <<url>> for including
  images.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.7:\n\n  * Changes in the way Haddock decides where to direct hyperlinks.
  \ Each entity\n    is now assigned a single \"home\" module, and all hyperlinks
  are directed\n    to that module.  See the docs (\"Hyperlinking and re-exported
  entities\")\n    for details.\n\n  * New options --ignore-all-exports, --hide\n\n
  \ * New option --use-package for creating documentation that hyperlinks to\n    the
  HTML documentation for existing packages on your system.  It works\n    by querying
  ghc-pkg for the location of the Haddock interface and\n    HTML for the given package.\n\n
  \ * Parts of the HTML documentation, notably lists of instances, are\n    now \"collapsible\"
  with a +/- button.  Also, the contents page is now\n    in the form of tree in which
  subtrees can be collapsed.\n\n  * Support for Microsoft DevHelp and HtmlHelp 2.0
  formats.\n\n  * Support for a short description for each module for the contents
  page.\n\n  * Compiles with GHC 6.4+\n\n  * Various bugfixes\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.6:\n\n  * Implicit parameters, zip comprehensions and 'mdo' are now\n
  \   supported by the parser.\n\n  * Some lexical bugs were fixed, mainly concerning
  literal paragraphs\n    next to non-literal paragraphs.\n\n  * New options:  --gen-index,
  --use-index, --gen-contents and --use-contents,\n    for generting a combined index
  and contents for several libraries\n    from the appropriate .haddock files.\n\n
  \ * There is now one index rather than separate Function/Constructor and\n    Type/Class
  indices.  Where a name refers to several entities, these\n    are listed separately
  in the index.\n\n  * New option: -v, elicits more verbose warnings.  Some warnings
  are\n    now turned off by default; Haddock should be a little less noisy\n    in
  general.\n\n  * Markup for definition lists has been added.  See the documentation\n
  \   for details.\n\n  * New option: --package for setting the package name.  The
  package\n    is listed alongside each module name in the combined contents.\n\n
  \ * Entities which are re-exported from another package now at least\n    leave
  a hyperlink in the generated HTML, rather than nothing at all.\n\n  * Some fixes
  for bugs which caused incorrect hyperlinks in the\n    generated HTML.  In particular,
  instances should now be linked\n    correctly.\n\n  * Some aesthetic improvements
  to the generated HTML.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.5:\n\n  * Compiles with recent versions of GHC.\n\n  * A few bugs have
  been fixed.\n\n  * New labelling/linking feature (see \"Anchors\" in the manual).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges
  in version 0.4:\n\n  * Import declarations which list entities in parentheses, or
  with\n    hiding clauses, are now properly supported.  Modulo one or two\n    small
  infelicities, the full Haskell modules system is now supported.\n\n  * Haddock is
  now more flexible about the placing of separators\n    (commas, semicolons) in relation
  to doc comments.\n\n  * There is support for generating and reading \"interface
  files\"\n    which describe the exports of a set of modules.  This is useful\n    for
  generating documentation which hyperlinks to\n    previously-generated documentation.\n\n
  \ * Support for generating the extra files required by the Microsoft\n    Help compiler.\n\n
  \ * New option: --prologue specifies a file of documentation which is\n    placed
  on the contents page.\n\n  * Many bugs fixed\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges
  in version 0.3:\n\n  * Documentation on individual function arguments is now implemented\n\n
  \ * Links can be made to identifiers that aren't in scope, by using\n    the fully
  qualified name.\n\n  * Instances are collected and listed with the appropriate classes\n
  \   and datatypes (not for derived instances yet).\n\n  * Single quotes are only
  interpreted specially when they surround a\n    legal Haskell identifier, otherwise
  they are treated literally.\n\n  * Bird-tracked text is now literal.  If you want
  marked-up text in\n    a code block, use the @...@ notation instead.\n\n  * Various
  changes to the layout, it generally looks nicer now.\n\n  * Various bugs fixed.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges
  in version 0.2:\n\n  * The [...] markup for typewriter font has been changed to
  @...@.\n\n  * Module attributes introduced (see the documentation for details).\n\n
  \ * {- ... -} style comments may now be used for documentation annotations\n\n  *
  Recursive modules are detected and reported as an error.\n\n  * Existential constructors
  and rank-N types are now groked by the parser\n\n  * Some type rendering cleaned
  up\n\n  * `abc' is accepted as well as 'abc' to markup an identifier\n\n  * Several
  bugs fixed, and error messages improved.\n"

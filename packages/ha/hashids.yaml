description: This is a Haskell port of the Hashids library. It is typically used to
  encode numbers to a format suitable for appearance in places like urls. It converts
  numbers like 347 into strings like yr8, or a list of numbers like [27, 986] into
  3kTMd. You can also decode those ids back. This is useful in bundling several parameters
  into one.

description: ! 'This library is currently experimental.


  The GHC part is solid, since it has been migrated from HaRe.


  The haskell-src-exts one is still in progress


  This package provides a set of data structures to

  manage the tie-up between a Haskell AST and the

  underlying tokens, such that it explicitly

  captures the Haskell layout rules and original

  formatting. As a result changes can be made to

  the AST and the tokens will be updated so that

  the source file can be recreated with only the

  updated parts changed. This makes it easier to

  write Haskell source code modification

  programmes.'

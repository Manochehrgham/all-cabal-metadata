description: ! 'This package is a rewrite of the @hashable@ library by Milan Straka
  and

  Johan Tibell, having the following goals:


  - Extensibility; it should be easy to implement a new hashing algorithm on

  any @Hashable@ type; in this package we provide SipHash and FNV-1a.


  - Honest hashing of values, and principled hashing of algebraic data types

  (see e.g. hashable issues #74 and #30)


  - Cross-platform consistent hash values, with a versioning guarantee. Where

  possible we ensure morally identical data hashes to indentical values

  regardless of processor word size and endianness.


  - Make implementing identical hash routines in other languages as painless

  as possible. In addition to SipHash, we provide an implementation of a

  simple hashing algorithm (FNV-1a) and make an effort to define Hashable

  instances in a way that is well-documented and sensible, so that e.g. one

  can easily implement a string hashing routine in JavaScript that will

  match the way we hash strings here.


  /Versioning/: Except for instances where we specifically note that we make

  no promise of consistency, changes to hash values entail a major version

  number bump.'

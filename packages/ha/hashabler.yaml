description: ! 'This package is a rewrite of the @hashable@ library by Milan Straka
  and

  Johan Tibell, having the following goals:


  - Extensibility; it should be easy to implement a new hashing algorithm on

  any @Hashable@ type, for instance if one needed more hash bits


  - Honest hashing of values, and principled hashing of algebraic data types

  (see e.g. hashable issues #74 and #30)


  - Cross-platform consistent hash values, with a versioning guarantee. Where

  possible we ensure morally identical data hashes to indentical values

  regardless of processor word size and endianness.


  - Make implementing identical hash routines in other languages as painless

  as possible. We provide an implementation of a simple hashing algorithm

  (FNV-1a) and make an effort define Hashable instances in a way that is

  well-documented and sensible, so that e.g. one can (hopefully) easily

  implement string hashing routine in JavaScript that will match the way we

  hash strings here.


  /Versioning/: Except for instances where we specifically note that we make

  no promise of consistency, changes to hash values entail a major version

  number bump.'

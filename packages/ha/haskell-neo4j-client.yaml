description: ! 'Library to interact with Neo4j databases.


  This library covers:


  -Cypher transactions


  -CRUD operations for nodes, relationships, labels and indexes


  -Batch calls for CRUD operations.



  All code has been tested with Neo4j versions 2.0.3,  2.1.5, 2.1.7 and 2.2.0


  2.2.0 added authentication to the API this driver uses, this is not supported yet
  by this driver but it will be soon.

  In the meantime you will have to disable it.'

description: ! 'This package provides compatibility with the library modules of Haskell

  98 and the FFI addendum, by means of wrappers around modules from

  the base package (which in many cases have additional features).

  However "Prelude", "Numeric" and "Foreign" are provided directly by

  the base package.'

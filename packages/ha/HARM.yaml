description: ! 'A simple ARM virtual machine designed for teaching

  assembly. See

  http://tinyurl.com/639v6u for details on internals and

  examples of how to use it. It is advised you look through the

  source on the site and try following along to really learn

  what''s going on. Currently the emulator does not use standard

  ARM assembly, but a custom variant. This will hopefully be

  changed in the near future.


  Two programs, runarm and dbgarm, are provided which can be

  used to run and debug the assembly.'

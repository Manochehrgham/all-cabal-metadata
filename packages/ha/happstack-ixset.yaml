description: ! 'Just pick which parts of your data structures you want indexed

  using an easy to use template-haskell function. Spare yourself the

  need to write, run, and maintain code that marshalls your data

  to/from an external relational database just for efficient

  queries. happstack-ixset relies on generics and TH to spare you

  the boilerplate normally required for such tasks.'

description: ! 'This package provides functions for generating hierarchical deterministic

  keys (BIP32). It also provides functions for building and signing both

  simple transactions and multisignature transactions. This package also

  provides a command lines application called hw (haskoin wallet). It is a

  lightweight bitcoin wallet featuring BIP32 key management, deterministic

  signatures (RFC-6979) and first order support for multisignature

  transactions. A library API for hw is also exposed.'

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/half.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/half)


  This package supplies half-precision floating point values w/ 1 bit of sign, 5 bits
  of exponent, 11 bits of mantissa trailing a leading 1 bit with proper underflow.


  These arise commonly in GPU applications.

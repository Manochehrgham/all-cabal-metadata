description: ! 'Bundles YUI 3.7.3 and includes a \"combo handler\" for use in

  Happstack which concatenates YUI modules server-side to send in a single

  HTTP request.  The YUI bundle can be embedded in compiled code with

  Template Haskell (install with @-fembed@) which means the files are

  served directly from memory, and also that you can compile and deploy a

  single executable without having to worry about deploying the YUI files

  as well.


  The benefits of using this over the Yahoo! CDN is that you can work

  offline and that you can host YUI yourself without sacrificing the

  benefits of \"combo loading\".


  The versioning scheme of this package is that the first part is the

  targeted Happstack series plus the bundled YUI version, such that 7351

  means \"Happstack 7, YUI 3.5.1\".  The second part is the major version

  of this package itself, as defined by the Package Versioning Policy.


  The package also includes some utilities for working with the YUI CSS

  modules and for using HSX to create YUI Node objects with JMacro.  In a

  future release, the plan is to add more utilities, for example a combo

  handler for YUI modules written using JMacro, tools for making it

  easier to work with modules like Uploader and Pjax and a quasi-quoter for

  compile-time syntax checked YQL queries.

description: ! 'This is a moderately complete small scheme interpreter.

  It implements most of R6RS, with the exception of call/cc.

  It is however starting to have a set of delimited

  continuations, reset/shift et al. It has a macro system,

  although not R6RS hygienic macros. It is also not

  necessarily fully tail-recursive; so it''s not

  industrial-strength. For playing with or learning scheme,

  it should be pretty good.'

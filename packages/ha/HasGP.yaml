description: A Haskell library implementing algorithms for supervised learning, roughly
  corresponding to chapters 1 to 5 of "Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning" by
  Carl Rasmussen and Christopher Williams, The MIT Press 2006. In particular, algorithms
  are provides for regression and for two-class classification using either the Laplace
  or EP approximation.

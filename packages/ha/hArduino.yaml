synopsis: Control your Arduino board from Haskell.
changelog: ! "* Hackage: (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hArduino)\n* GitHub:
  \ (http://leventerkok.github.com/hArduino)\n\n* Latest Hackage released version:
  0.9\n\n### Version 0.9, 2014-02-09\n * Added example program for Morse encoding.\n
  \  Original idea by Antoine Dumont. Thanks!\n\n### Version 0.8, 2013-12-15\n * Add
  support for Piezo speakers\n * Add simple musical note playing support, and a\n
  \  jingle-bells playing example. (Not a great\n   rendering, but still recognizable!)\n\n###
  Version 0.7, 2013-11-09\n * Export LCD type, for ease of programming\n * Added the
  number guessing game using the OSEpp shield.\n   Thanks to David Palmer for lending
  me his shield to play with!\n\n### Version 0.6, 2013-03-08\n\n * Make hArduino Windows
  friendly by removing dependence\n   on the unix package. Thanks to Andriy Drozdyuk
  for pointing\n   out the Windows compilation issue. (Tested on Windows 7.)\n\n###
  Version 0.5, 2013-03-07\n \n * New hardware components supported:\n     * Shift-registers\n
  \    * Seven-segment displays\n     * Servo-motors\n * New examples:\n    * PulseIn:
  Demonstrates the use of reading pulses\n    * PulseOut: Demonstrates the use of
  sending pulses\n    * Distance: Measure the distance using an HC-SC04 sensor\n    *
  Seven-segment: Display characters on a seven-segment display\n    * Servo: Control
  a servo board\n * New functions:\n     * pulseIn_hostTiming/pulseOut_hostTiming:
  Send and receive pulses.\n         * NB. These functions use host-timing: watch
  out for accuracy\n     * pulse: Send and receive a digital pulse on a pin.\n         *
  This function is more accurate than the pair above, as\n\t   it uses a custom Firmata
  command to measure the pulse.\n\t   However, you need a custom Firmata version to
  use this\n\t   function, as the standard version that ships with Arduino\n\t   as
  of March 2013 does not support this functionality yet.\n     * time: Measure the
  time taken by an Arduino action\n     * timeOut: Run an action only for the given-time-out\n\n###
  Version 0.4, 2013-03-05\n\n * Bugfix: Remove spurious extra call to user program\n
  * Rework pin assignment logic, making use of analog/digital pins much more clearer.\n
  * Better exception handling\n * Remove threadDelay workaround on the Mac. NB. If
  you are running on OSX, then\n   you need at least GHC 7.6.2!\n  \n### Version 0.3,
  2013-02-10\n\n * Library\n    * Add support for pull-up resistors\n    * Implement
  routines for waiting on digital triggers\n    * Add support for reading analog values
  and setting sampling frequency.\n    * Add support for LCDs (based on the Hitachi
  44780 chip)\n    * Better handling for Ctrl-C interrupts\n * Examples\n    * Counter:
  Use push buttons to count up and down\n    * Analog: Reading analog values\n    *
  LCD: Control an LCD, writing text/glyphs etc\n\n### Version 0.2, 2013-01-28\n\n
  * Library\n    * Rewrite the communication engine\n    * Digital input/output implementation\n
  * Examples\n    * Button: Detecting putton pushes\n\n### Version 0.1, 2013-01-14\n\n
  * Library\n    * Initial design\n    * Created home page at: http://leventerkok.github.com/hArduino
  \n * Examples\n    * Blink: Hello world!\n"

description: ! 'If you have a large routing table in Happstack and want

  to insert a new handler, you might run into overlap problems

  (ambiguity).  The new handler might not fire because it matches

  against a URL that is already handled earlier.  Or if you put your

  new handler first, it might steal requests from existing handlers.

  This Happstack support library allows you to detect overlap cases

  and build unambiguous routing tables where the order of the handlers

  is irrelevant.'

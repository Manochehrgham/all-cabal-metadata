description: ! 'The rise of web platforms and their associated /apps/ represents a

  new way of developing and deploying software.  Sites such as

  Facebook and Yammer are no longer written by a single entity, but

  rather are freely extended by third-party developers offering

  competing features to users.


  Allowing an app to access more user data allows developers to build

  more compelling products. It also opens the door to accidental or

  malicious breaches of user privacy. In the case of a website like

  Facebook, exposing access to a user''s private messages would allow

  an external developer to build a search feature. Exciting!  But,

  another developer can take advantage of this feature to build an app

  that mines private messages for credit card numbers, ad keywords, or

  other sensitive data.


  Frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Django, Yesod, etc. are geared

  towards building monolithic web sites. And, they are great for

  this! However, they are not designed for websites that integrate

  third-party code, and thus lack a good mechanism for building such

  multi-app platforms without sacrificing a user''s security or an

  app''s functionality.


  Hails is explicitly designed for building web /platforms/, where it

  is expected that a site will comprise many mutually-distrustful

  components written by a variety of entities.  We built Hails around

  two core design principles.


  * Separation of policy:

  Data access policies should be concisely specified alongside data

  structures and schemas, rather than strewn throughout the

  codebase in a series of conditionals. Code that implements this

  is called a /policy module/ in Hails (see "Hails.PolicyModule").


  * Mandatory access control (MAC):

  Data access policies should be mandatory even once code has

  obtained access to data.  MAC lets platform components modules

  productively interact by sharing data, despite mutual distrust.

  Haskell lets us implement MAC at a fine grained level using the

  information flow control library "LIO".


  A Hails platform hosts two types of code: /apps/ and /policy

  modules/. Apps encompass what would traditionally be considered

  controller and view logic. Policy modules are libraries that

  implement both the model and the data security policy. They are

  invoked directly by apps or other policy modules, but run with

  different privileges from the invoking code. Both apps and policy

  modules can be implemented by untrusted third parties, with the user

  only needing to trust the policy module governing the data in

  question. Separating of policy code from app code allows users to

  inspect and more easily unserstand the overall security provided by

  the system, while MAC guarantees that these policies are enforced

  in an end-to-end fashion.'

description: ! 'HaRP, or Haskell Regular Patterns, is a Haskell extension

  that extends the normal pattern matching facility with

  the power of regular expressions. This expressive power

  is highly useful in a wide range of areas, including text parsing

  and XML processing. Regular expression patterns in HaRP work over

  ordinary Haskell lists ([]) of arbitrary type. We have implemented

  HaRP as a pre-processor to ordinary Haskell.

description: ! 'Software floating point with type-tagged variable mantissa precision,

  implemented using a strict pair of ''Integer'' and ''Int'' scaled alike

  to ''decodeFloat''.  Version 0.4 adds more number-type-agnostic numerical

  algorithms (''sin'', ''cos'', ''tan'').


  Instances of the usual numeric type classes are provided, along with

  additional operators (with carefully chosen fixities) to coerce,

  adjust and reify precisions.


  The intention with this library is to be relatively simple but still

  useful, refer to the documentation for caveats concerning accuracy and

  assorted ill-behaviour.


  Usage with ghc(i)-7.0.4 might require @-fcontext-stack=100@.'

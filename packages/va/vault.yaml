description: ! 'A /vault/ is a persistent store for values of arbitrary types.

  It''s like having first-class access to the storage space behind IORefs.


  The data structure is analogous to a bank vault,

  where you can access different bank boxes with different keys;

  hence the name.


  Also provided is a /locker/ type, representing a store for a single element.'

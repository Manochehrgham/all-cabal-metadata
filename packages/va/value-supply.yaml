description: ! 'This library can be used to generate values (for example, new names)

  without the need to thread state.  This means that functions that

  need to generate new values only need a supply object as an argument,

  and they do not need to return a new supply object as a result.

  This decreases the number of data-dependencies in a program, which

  makes it easier to exploit parallelism.

  The technique for generating new values is based on the paper

  ''''On Generating Unique Names''''

  by Lennart Augustsson, Mikael Rittri, and Dan Synek.'

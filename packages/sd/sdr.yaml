description: ! 'Write software defined radio applications in Haskell.


  Features:


  * Signal processing blocks can be chained together using the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes
  Pipes> library


  * Zero copy design


  * Signal processing functions are implemented in both Haskell and C (with SIMD acceleration)


  * Can FIR filter, decimate and resample


  * Helper functions for FIR filter design using window functions and plotting of
  the frequency response


  * FFTs using <http://www.fftw.org/ FFTW>


  * Line and waterfall plots using OpenGL


  * FM demodulation


  * PulseAudio sound sink


  * <http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr rtl-sdr> based radio source supported
  and other sources are easily added


  See <https://github.com/adamwalker/sdr> for more features and screenshots.


  A collection of simple apps that use this library can be found <https://github.com/adamwalker/sdr-apps
  here>. These include an FM radio receiver, an OpenGL waterfall plotter and an AM
  radio receiver.'

description: ! 'This small library provides convenience functions to draw

  on SDL2 textures with Cairo. As Cairo is complicated, it also

  provides a drawing API, which is heavily inspired by Processing and

  is much more user-friendly. If it does not support something,

  you can always embed direct Cairo commands, so you do not have

  to decide!'

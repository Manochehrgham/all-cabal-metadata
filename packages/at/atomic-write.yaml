  Atomically write to a file on POSIX-compliant systems while preserving

  permissions.


  On most Unix systems, `mv` is an atomic operation. This makes it simple to write

  to a file atomically just by using the mv operation. However, this will

  destroy the permissions on the original file. This library does the following

  to preserve permissions while atomically writing to a file:


  * If an original file exists, take those permissions and apply them to the

  temp file before `mv`ing the file into place.


  * If the original file does not exist, create a following with default

  permissions (based on the currently-active umask).


  This way, when the file is `mv`''ed into place, the permissions will be the ones

  held by the original file.


  This library is based on similar implementations found in common libraries in

  Ruby and Python:


  * <http://apidock.com/rails/File/atomic_write/class Ruby on Rails includes a similar
  method called atomic_write>


  * <https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/c4631816132fcfefaba3d123a1d0dfe8bc2866bb/lib/chef/file_content_management/deploy/mv_unix.rb#L23:L71
  Chef includes atomic update functionality>


  * <https://github.com/sashka/atomicfile There is a python library for atomically
  updating a file>


  To use `atomic-write`, import the module corresponding to the type you wish to

  write atomically, e.g., to write a (strict) ByteString atomically:


  > import System.AtomicWrite.Writer.ByteString


  Then you can use the atomicWrite function that accepts a `FilePath` and a

  `ByteString`, e.g.:


  > atomicWrite myFilePath myByteString'

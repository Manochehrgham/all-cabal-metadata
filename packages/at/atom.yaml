description: ! 'Atom is a Haskell DSL for designing hard realtime embedded software.

  Based on guarded atomic actions (similar to STM), Atom enables

  highly concurrent programming without the need for mutex locking.

  In addition, Atom performs compile-time task scheduling and generates code

  with deterministic execution time and constant memory use, simplifying the

  process of timing verification and memory consumption in hard realtime applications.

  Without mutex locking and run-time task scheduling, Atom eliminates

  the need and overhead of RTOSs for many embedded applications.'

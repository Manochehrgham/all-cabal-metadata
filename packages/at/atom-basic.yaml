description: ! 'This library provides a type for an Atom feed

  (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287) and a way to produce its XML. XML is

  constructed with the help of a record of construction functions (`XMLGen`)

  that you provide. This allows you to easily use this with the XML library

  of your choice.'

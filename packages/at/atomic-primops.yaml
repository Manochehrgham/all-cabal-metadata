description: ! 'After GHC 7.4 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but it''s

  difficult to use safely, because pointer equality is a highly

  unstable property in Haskell.  This library provides a safer method

  based on the concept of "Tickets".


  Also, this library uses the "foreign primop" capability of GHC to

  add access to other variants that may be of

  interest, specifically, compare and swap inside an array.


  Note that as of GHC 7.8, the relevant primops have been included in GHC itself.

  This library is engineered to work pre- and post-GHC-7.8, while exposing the

  same interface.


  Changes in 0.3:


  * Major internal change.  Duplicate the barrier code from the GHC RTS and thus

  enable support for executables that are NOT built with ''-threaded''.


  Changes in 0.4:


  * Further internal changes, duplicate ''cas'' routine well as barriers.


  * Add `fetchAddByteArrayInt`


  * Add an `Unboxed` counter variant that uses movable "ByteArray"s on the GHC heap.


  Changes in 0.5:


  * Remove dependency on bits-atomic unless a flag is turned on.


  Changes in 0.5.0.2:


  * IMPORTANT BUGFIXES - don''t use earlier versions.  They have been marked deprecated.


  Changes in 0.6.1


  * This is a good version to use for GHC 7.8.3.  It includes portability and bug
  fixes

  and adds atomicModifyIORefCAS.


  Changes in 0.7:


  * This release adds support for GHC 7.10 and its expanded library of (now inline)
  primops.


  Changes in 0.8:


  * Implements additional fetch primops available in GHC 7.10'

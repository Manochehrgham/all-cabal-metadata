description: ! 'This package provides an implementation of

  "Data.Attoparsec.Text" in terms of Parsec.

  It can be used to write parsers that can be compiled against

  both Attoparsec and Parsec.


  Attoparsec is an awesome and very fast library, but it still

  has a weak point: It does not generate very useful error

  messages on parse errors.  Compiling an Attoparsec parser

  against Parsec can be useful for at least two scenarios.


  - Parsec can be used while developing Attoparsec parsers, so

  that you get better error messages on failing test cases.


  - You can use Attoparsec for parsing, so that you benefit

  from it''s speed.  And on parse errors you can re-parse the

  input with Parsec, so that you can display a useful error

  message to the user.


  A simple usage example is here:

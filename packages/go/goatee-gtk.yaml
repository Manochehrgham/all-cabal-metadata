description: ! 'Goatee is a Go library and game editor, written in Haskell.  It provides
  a

  GUI for recording, studying, and editing game records.  Underneath this is a

  portable library for manipulating SGF files to build UIs and tools.  Goatee

  aims to be full-featured by supporting all of the SGF spec and allowing for

  full and easy customization of the game records you create.


  This package is the GTK+ UI.'

description: ! 'This library provides bounded channels similar to those popularized

  by the Go programming language.


  THIS LIBRARY IS STILL ALPHA AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE.


  Breaking changes during the 0.0.X series won''t result in a major

  version bump (I hope to release a stable 1.0.0 soon).


  Please give gochan a try and file an issue or pull request if you

  discover any ways to improve this library.'

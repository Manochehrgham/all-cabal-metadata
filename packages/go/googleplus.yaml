description: ! 'Will implement the Google+ REST API. Google+ is a social network made
  by

  Google. Found out more at <http://plus.google.com>.

  Implements the full API as of Oct 15, 2011. Only features read-only API

  access beacuse that is all that Google has published thus far. Both API and

  OAuth authentication is supported, but note that if you intend to use OAuth,

  this library does not currently provide the means to procure and renew OAuth

  tokens.'

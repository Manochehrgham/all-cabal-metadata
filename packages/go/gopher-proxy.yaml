description: ! "# gopher-proxy\n\ngopher-proxy is a tiny [wai](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai)
  application running on top of [warp](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp).
  It acts as a gopher-over-http proxy for a specific server, e. g. to http-ify a gopher
  space.\n\n## Usage\n\nExample usage:\n\n    gopher-proxy --host foo.org --http-port
  8080\n\nIn this particular example, gopher-proxy would proxy the foo.org gopher
  server and bind its http service on `127.0.0.1:8080` (to be proxied to by another
  web server like `nginx`).\n\nThere are these additional flags which allow tweaking
  of exact behavior as well:\n\noption                | meaning\n----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n`--port`
  \             | The port of the gopher server, defaults to `70`\n`--css-url`           |
  Use some specific css file instead of the default one.\n`--css-url`           |
  The http path of the css file, defaults to `/gopher-proxy.css` (should be changed,
  if your gopher server has a file with the same name\n`--base-url`          | The
  path of the directory which will appear as root directory of gopher-proxy to the
  user, defaults to `/`. Should be changed if you configured your proxying web server
  to expose gopher-proxy as, say `/gopher-space/`.\n`--listen-public`     | If this
  flag is set, gopher-proxy will accept connections on its public IP address(es).\n`--default-mime-type`
  | Mime type to use if spacecookie can't guess it, defaults to \"application/octet-stream\"\n`--timeout`
  \          | Timeout when connecting in milliseconds, defaults to 10 seconds.\n\n##
  Things to keep in mind\n\n* Your gopher server must send UTF-8-encoded gopher menus\n*
  gopher-proxy might misinterpret certain content, because of the context-sensitive
  nature of gopher\n* gopher-proxy does not support Gopher+\n\n## Roadmap\n\n[ ] Add
  Logging\n"

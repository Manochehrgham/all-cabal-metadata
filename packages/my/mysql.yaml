description: ! "# mysql: bindings to the mysqlclient library\n\nThis library is a
  Haskell binding to the MySQL `mysqlclient` client\nlibrary.  It is a fairly faithful,
  low level library that implements\nmost of the MySQL client API.  The major departure
  from the C API is\nthat in Haskell, resource management is mostly automatic and
  safe.\n\nThis library deliberately avoids the question of providing a \"good\"\nAPI.
  Its purpose is to serve as a base upon which higher-level\nlibraries can be built.\n\n#
  Licensing\n\nThis library is BSD-licensed under the terms of the\n[MySQL FOSS License
  Exception](http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/).\n\nSince
  this library links against the GPL-licensed `mysqlclient`\nlibrary, a non-open-source
  application that uses it *may* be subject\nto the terms of the GPL.\n\n# To do\n\n*
  Add support for prepared statements. The prepared statement API is\n  huge and of
  dubious performance value, so it's not currently a\n  priority for us. Patches welcome!\n\n#
  Get involved!\n\nWe are happy to receive bug reports, fixes, documentation enhancements,\nand
  other improvements.\n\nPlease report bugs via the\n[github issue tracker](http://github.com/bos/mysql/issues).\n\nMaster
  [git repository](http://github.com/bos/mysql):\n\n* `git clone git://github.com/bos/mysql.git`\n\nThere's
  also a [Mercurial mirror](http://bitbucket.org/bos/mysql):\n\n* `hg clone http://bitbucket.org/bos/mysql`\n\n(You
  can create and contribute changes using either git or Mercurial.)\n\n# Authors\n\nThis
  library is written and maintained by Bryan O'Sullivan,\n<bos@serpentine.com>.\n"

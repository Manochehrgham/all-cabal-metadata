description: ! 'HGamer3D is a toolset for developing 3D games in the programming

  language Haskell. This package provides the Ogre binding.

  HGamer3D-Ogre-Binding is available on Windows and Linux.

  This binding does not claim to have full coverage of Ogre

  functionality, but only to support what is needed for the

  HGamer3D-Graphics3D package.'

description: ! 'HGamer3D is a game engine for developing 3D games in the programming

  language Haskell. This package provides the SFML binding.

  HGamer3D-SFML-Binding is available on Windows and Linux.

  This binding does not claim to have full coverage of SFML

  functionality, but only to support what is needed for the

  HGamer3D-Audio and HGamer3D-InputSystem packages.'

description: ! 'A simple graphics library, designed to give the programmer access

  to most interesting parts of the Win32 Graphics Device Interface

  and X11 library without exposing the programmer to the pain and

  anguish usually associated with using these interfaces.


  The library also includes a module Graphics.SOE providing the

  interface used in "The Haskell School of Expression", by Paul

  Hudak, cf <http://www.haskell.org/soe/>.'

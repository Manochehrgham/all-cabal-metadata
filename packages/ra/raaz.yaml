description: ! 'Raaz is a cryptographic network library for Haskell

  designed to use strong typing to eliminate some common errors that

  occur in cryptographic settings like side channel attacks. This

  package implements basic types and cryptographic primitives like

  hashes, macs etc. Actual network protocols are expected to use this

  library. Common abstractions like for example packet parsing should

  be part of this library.'

description: ! 'Random number generation based on entropy sources

  able to produce a small but well-defined set of

  primitive variates.  Also includes facilities for

  \"completing\" partial implementations, making it

  easy to define new entropy sources in a way that

  is naturally forward-compatible.


  Changes in 0.3.0.6: Fixed overzealous fix in 0.3.0.5.  The people responsible for
  sacking the people who have been sacked, etc., have been sacked.


  Changes in 0.3.0.5: Renamed some internal modules and accidentally some external
  ones too.  Whoops.  Please don''t use this version, it will only end in tears.


  Changes in 0.3.0.4: Fixed a typo that broke building

  with MTL-1


  Changes in 0.3.0.3: Fixes for GHC''s deprecation

  of Foreign.unsafePerformIO


  Changes in 0.3.0.2: Fixes for GHC 7.2.*''s crazy

  Template Haskell changes.'

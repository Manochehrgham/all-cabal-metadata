description: ! 'A quasiquoter for raw string literals - that is, string literals that
  don''t

  recognise the standard escape sequences (such as @\''\\n\''@). Basically, they

  make your code more readable by freeing you from the responsibility to

  escape backslashes. They are useful when working with regular expressions,

  DOS/Windows paths and markup languages (such as XML).


  See @examples/RawRegex.hs@ for a usage example.'

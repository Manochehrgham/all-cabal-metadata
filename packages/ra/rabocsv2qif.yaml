description: ! 'The rabocsv2qif package exposes a library, Rabobank, and an

  executable, rabocsv2qif. With the executable you can quickly

  create a timestamped QIF file from a Rabobank CSV file with

  transactions. The library exposes a method, toQif, that can be

  used to create QIF data in code. It simply takes a String and

  returns a String.'

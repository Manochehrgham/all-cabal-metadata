  \ \n    \n    This library has basic working code \n    to enable to start nodes
  and to connect them with each other. \n    \n    The library may be extended \n
  \   however you are most likely to write your own code that does much more. \n    \n
  \   This library is simple on purpose. \n    It took me a few days to write this
  code and make it work.    \n    \n    To start the program that comes with this
  library:\n    \n    start the same program in multiple consoles: 1 per node\n     \n
  \   pass 2 args:\n    \n        1. path to config.json (see enclosed test-conf.json)\n
  \       2. idx of this node in the cluster: 0 - (length Cluster -1)\n    \n    The
  program exchanges pings with other nodes which are expected to pong back. \n    Both
  pings & pongs are output to stdout\n    \n    When you shut one node, the other
  nodes stdout notifications about that node     "

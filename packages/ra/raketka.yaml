changelog: ! "#####  1.1.1\n    change common state from TVar s to s\n    \n    pass
  init common state  \n\n#####  1.1\n    add custom state to Server\n    \n    peer
  state type is a configurable param\n    \n    note : package build may fail \n\n
  \   due to version clash between aeson, vector, primitive packages\n    \n    https://github.com/ciez/vector
  is a patched version of vector-0.11.0.0\n    \n    I do not claim to have any knowledge
  about vector package workings. \n\n    Did basic refactoring: moved some code to
  a different module and followed some GHC suggestions. It builds and it works with
  raketka.  \n    \n\n#####  1.0\n    start multiple nodes\n    \n    on start nodes
  ping suggested (in config) nodes - which pong back - and establish monitored connections"

  clash between aeson, vector, primitive packages\n    \n    https://github.com/ciez/vector
  is a patched version of vector-0.11.0.0\n\n\n\n    * basic distributed-process node\n
  \   * configurable peers\n\n    Begin reading at Control.Distributed.Raketka.Type.Arg\n\n

  \ \n    \n    This library: \n    \n        functionality: \n            * start
  nodes \n            * connect them with each other\n            * exchanges pings
  with other nodes which are expected to pong back\n            * received pings &
  pongs are output to stdout\n            * when 1 node is disconnected or stops,
  the other nodes stdout notifications about this\n    \n        may be extended \n
  \       however you are most likely to write your own code that does much more.
  \n    \n        is simple on purpose, does only a few things which seem to be common
  in distributed arch \n    \n    To start the program that comes with this library:\n
  \   \n        start the same program in multiple consoles: 1 per node\n     \n        2
  args are expected:\n    \n            1. path to config.json (see test-conf.json)\n
  \           2. idx of this node in the cluster: 0 .. (length Cluster -1)    \n         "

description: ! 'These bindings do not cover the entire API, they support

  read, write, stat, creation, and unlinking with shared

  locks.


  You can perform these actions with combinations of sync,

  async, and atomic execution.


  The "System.Rados.Monadic" module is recommended for

  safety/ease of use.


  The "System.Rados.Base" module is possibly more flexible

  but requires you to clean up your own resources and track

  a lot of state.


  Note: To use atomic writes, you must build with the

  /atomic_writes/ build flag.


  Stability: These bindings are not as polished as they could be, but

  are in production use at Anchor Hosting as of Jan 2014.'

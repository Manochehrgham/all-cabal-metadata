description: ! 'RSAGL, the RogueStar Animation and Graphics Library,

  was specifically designed for a computer game called

  roguestar, but effort has been made to make it accessable

  to other projects that might benefit from it.  It includes

  mathematical utilities, a 3D modeling language based on

  parametric surfaces, and an arrow-based FRP framework.'

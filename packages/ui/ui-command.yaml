description: ! 'This is a framework for creating commandline applications. It

  provides various features which give a polished feel to your

  application.


  It is designed to encourage you to provide clear documentation

  and working examples. It implements default ''''help''''

  and ''''man'''' commands for your application, which will layout help

  text and generate Unix-style man pages.


  It provides special handling for applications of the form

  ''''program command args'''', the style of interaction common in revision

  control systems. It will dispatch to handler functions that you

  provide for each command, and also provide command-specific

  help to the user.'

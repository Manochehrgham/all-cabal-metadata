description: ! '# x86-64


  The primary goal of x86-64 is to provide a lightweight assembler for machine generated
  64 bit x86 assembly instructions.


  Features:


  -   The size of operands are statically checked. For example, exchanging `rax` with
  `eax` raises a compile time error rather than a code-generation time error. As a
  consequence, code generation is faster because the sizes are statically known.

  -   Immediate values are automatically converted to smaller size if possible.

  -   De Bruijn indices are used instead of named labels

  -   Quickcheck tests: You can quickcheck your x86 processor! Please report failures,
  there is a higher chance that the error is in this library rather than in your processor.

description: ! 'Adds a module "Graphics.UI.Gtk.Layout.Rpn" to @gtk2hs@. This

  module defines a type @RPN@ for operators, which is an

  instance of ''Data.Monoid.Monoid'' class.  You can combine those

  operators using reverse polish notation, as made popular by,

  say, HP calculators. There are operators for layout elements,

  like expanders, panes, boxes and notebooks, and for a few

  other widgets, like buttons and labels. You can also insert

  any existing @gtk2hs@ widget in the stack.'

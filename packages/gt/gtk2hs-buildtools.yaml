description: ! 'This package provides a set of helper programs necessary to

  build the Gtk2Hs suite of libraries. These tools include

  a modified c2hs binding tool that is used to generate

  FFI declarations, a tool to build a type hierarchy that

  mirrors the C type hierarchy of GObjects found in glib,

  and a generator for signal declarations that are used

  to call back from C to Haskell. These tools are not needed

  to actually run Gtk2Hs programs.'

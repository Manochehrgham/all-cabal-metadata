description: ! 'Generates a simple form which allows users to input JSON values of
  type Bool, Rational and String.

  Saving of the form data is performed on "focus change".

  This means that you provide jsInputNew with a special callback

  and that callback gets run every time the user changes a value in the form.

  You can then save the contents of the form,

  or sync them to your application''s own internal state.'

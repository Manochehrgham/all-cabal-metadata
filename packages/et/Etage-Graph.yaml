description: ! 'Data-flow based graph algorithms using the "Control.Etage" framework,
  showcasing its use for data-flow

  computations. It is meant to be used with the "Data.Graph.Inductive" package which
  provides graph structures

  these algorithms take as an input.


  Currently only the shortest paths computation is implemented (from all to all nodes).


  Also a benchmarking @test@ program is provided, comparing the performance with algorithms
  found in the

  "Data.Graph.Inductive" package.'

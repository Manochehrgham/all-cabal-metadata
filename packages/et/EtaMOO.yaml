description: ! 'LambdaMOO is a network-accessible, multi-user, programmable, interactive

  system well-suited to the construction of text-based adventure games,

  conferencing systems, and other collaborative software.


  EtaMOO is an experimental multithreaded implementation of LambdaMOO in

  Haskell with anticipated ready support for 64-bit MOO integers and Unicode

  MOO strings. The implementation follows the specifications of the LambdaMOO

  Programmer''s Manual, and should be compatible with most LambdaMOO databases

  as of about version 1.8.3 of the LambdaMOO server code.


  /N.B./ This is (currently) incomplete software. It is not yet fully usable,

  although with further development it is hoped that it soon will be.'

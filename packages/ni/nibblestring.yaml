description: ! 'Data.NibbleString holds an array of Nibbles (4-bit values), and provides
  an interface similar to that in Data.ByteString.

  Although similar to Bytestring, there are obvious differences.  The "length" of
  a nibblestring will be twice that of bytestring,

  unpacking a nibblestring will result in two items per byte, etc.

  Data.NibbleString is intended to be imported qualified.'

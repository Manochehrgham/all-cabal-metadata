description: ! 'Bindings for the (now open source!) Z3 4./x/ Theorem Prover (<https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3>).


  * "Z3.Base.C" provides the raw foreign imports from Z3''s C API.


  * "Z3.Base" does the marshaling of values between Haskell and C,

  and transparently handles reference counting of Z3 objects for you.


  * "Z3.Monad" provides a convenient monadic wrapper for the common usage scenario.


  Examples: <https://bitbucket.org/iago/z3-haskell/src/tip/examples>

  Installation:


  * /Unix-like/: Just be sure to use the standard locations for

  dynamic libraries (\/usr\/lib) and header files (\/usr\/include),

  or else use the --extra-lib-dirs and --extra-include-dirs Cabal flags.


  (Hackage reports a build failure because Z3''s library is missing.)'

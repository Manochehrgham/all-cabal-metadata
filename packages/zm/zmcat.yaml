description: ! 'ZeroMQ is a handy way to communicate between applications:


  [Rationale:] Zmcat is an handy command-line tool to debug or communicate

  with ZeroMQ applications from the shell.

  One use of zmcat is to easily audit, monitor, add cron-jobs shell scripts

  which speak zmq.


  [Limitations:]

  A limitation is that Zmcat only supports printable text. Support for

  random binary streams will come later.

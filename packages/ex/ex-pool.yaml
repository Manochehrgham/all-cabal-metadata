description: ! 'A fork of ''resource-pool'' using ''MonadIO'' and ''exceptions''.


  The library also contains a number of fixes and enhancements which are not yet

  included in a Hackage release of the original library. Apart from that, this

  library is a drop-in replacement for ''resource-pool'', useful in cases where a

  more general monadic type is desirable.'

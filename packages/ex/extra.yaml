description: ! 'A library of extra functions for the standard Haskell libraries. Most
  functions are simple additions, filling out missing functionality. A few functions
  are available in later versions of GHC, but this package makes them available back
  to GHC 7.2.


  The module "Extra" documents all functions provided by this library. Modules such
  as "Data.List.Extra" provide extra functions over "Data.List" and also reexport
  "Data.List". Users are recommended to replace "Data.List" imports with "Data.List.Extra"
  if they need the extra functionality.'

description: ! "exact-combinatorics\n===================\n\nThis is a simple package
  and should be easy to install. You should\nbe able to use one of the following standard
  methods to install it.\n\n    -- With cabal-install and without the source:\n    $>
  cabal install exact-combinatorics\n    \n    -- With cabal-install and with the
  source already:\n    $> cd exact-combinatorics\n    $> cabal install\n    \n    --
  Without cabal-install, but with the source already:\n    $> cd exact-combinatorics\n
  \   $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build\n
  \   $> runhaskell Setup.hs test\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source\n
  \   $> runhaskell Setup.hs copy\n    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register\n\nThe test
  step is optional and currently does nothing. The Haddock\nstep is also optional.\n\n\nPortability\n===========\n\nAn
  attempt has been made to keep this library as portable as possible.\nIt is Haskell98
  except for the use of CPP, in order to get the\nHaddock documentation to come out
  right.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------- fin.\n"

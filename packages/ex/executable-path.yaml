description: ! 'The documentation of "System.Environment.getProgName" says that

  \"However, this is hard-to-impossible to implement on some non-Unix OSes,

  so instead, for maximum portability, we just return the leafname

  of the program as invoked.\"

  This library tries to provide the missing path.'

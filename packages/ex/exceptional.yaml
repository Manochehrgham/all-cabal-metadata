description: ! "exceptional\n===========\n\nThis is a Haskell library that exists
  to house a type:\n\n```haskell\ndata Exceptional x\n  = Failure String\n  | Success
  x\n```\n\nIt's much like `Maybe`, except instead of `Nothing`, we have `Failure\nString`.\n\nA
  comparison could also be made to `Either String`. I made this\nlibrary because I
  was dissatisfied with the `Monad` instance for\n`Either`. In this type, `fail =
  Failure`. It's rather simple.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\n    cabal install exceptional\n\nOr,
  add `exceptional` to the `build-depends` field in your `.cabal`\nfile."

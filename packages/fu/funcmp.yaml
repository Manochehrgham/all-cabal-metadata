description: ! 'Functional MetaPost is a Haskell frontend to the

  MetaPost language by John Hobby. Users write their

  graphics as Haskell programs, which then emit MetaPost

  code that can be compiled into encapsulated PostScript

  files and smoothly included into e.g. LaTeX.


  A collection of useful examples how to use Functional

  MetaPost can be found in the user''s manual at

  <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Manual_eng.ps>. The

  document doesn''t offer very much detail in terms of

  explanations, but the code samples are quite helpful.


  Further documentation can be found in the original

  thesis that describes the implementation. The text is

  available in German at

  <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Thesis.ps> and in

  English at

  <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Thesis_eng.ps>.


  Last but not least, there is a tutorial that offers many

  helpful examples available in German at

  <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Tutorial.ps> and in

  English at

  <http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Tutorial_eng.ps>.'

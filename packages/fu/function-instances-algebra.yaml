synopsis: Instances of the Algebra.* classes for functions

description: ! 'This package provides instances for functions @(k -> a)@ of the classes

  Absolute, Algebraic, Differential, Field, Lattice, Monoid, Ring and Transcendental

  from the numeric-prelude package. An instance for Additive already comes with the

  original package.


  If @a@ has an instance for one of the classes, then @(k -> a)@ has too.

  The instances do what you would expect. Values become constant functions:


  @

  zero = const zero

  @


  Unary functions are composed:


  @

  sin f = sin . f

  @


  Binary functions fan out the input and combine both results:


  @

  f + g = \\x -> f x + g x

  @


  You can either import them separately or import @Data.Function.Instances.Algebra@
  to

  get them all at once.'

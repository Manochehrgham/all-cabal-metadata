description: ! 'FunGEn (Functional Game Engine) is a BSD-licensed, cross-platform,

  OpenGL/GLUT-based, non-FRP game engine/framework written in

  Haskell. Created by Andre Furtado in 2002, it''s the oldest Haskell

  game engine, and with very few dependencies and two example games,

  it''s one of the easiest ways to get started with Haskell game

  development.

  The FunGEn library provides:

  * Initialization, updating, removing, rendering and grouping

  routines for game objects

  * Definition of a game background (or map), including texture-based

  maps and tile maps

  * Reading and intepretation of the player''s keyboard and mouse input

  * Collision detection

  * Time-based functions and pre-defined game actions

  * Loading and displaying of 24-bit bitmap files

  * Some debugging and game performance evaluation facilities

  This package receives only basic maintenance (see home page).'

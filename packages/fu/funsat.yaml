description: ! 'Funsat is a native Haskell SAT solver that uses modern techniques
  for

  solving SAT instances.  Current features include two-watched literals,

  conflict-directed learning, non-chronological backtracking, a VSIDS-like

  dynamic variable ordering, and restarts.  Our goal is to facilitate

  convenient embedding of a reasonably fast SAT solver as a constraint

  solving backend in other applications.

  Currently along this theme we provide unsatisfiable core generation (see

  "Funsat.Resolution") and a logical circuit interface (see "Funsat.Circuit").

  New in 0.6.2: works with ghc-6.12 and fixed some space leaks. =/'

description: ! 'Yet another set of Haskell bindings to <http://www.fftw.org/ FFTW>,
  the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West.


  These are low level bindings with some type safety for a small subset of FFTW''s
  functionality. Raise an Issue on Github if you need something I haven''t implemented.


  Unlike the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fft fft> package, this package provides
  low level manipulation of FFTW plans (such as `fftw_plan_dft_1d`).


  Unlike the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-fftw vector-fftw> package,
  this package is based on pointers instead of the Vector datatype and it avoids copying
  the input arrays by assuming that the pointers are aligned as FFTW expects.'

description: ! 'C->Haskell assists in the development of Haskell bindings to C

  libraries. It extracts interface information from C header

  files and generates Haskell code with foreign imports and

  marshaling. Unlike writing foreign imports by hand (or using

  hsc2hs), this ensures that C functions are imported with the

  correct Haskell types.'

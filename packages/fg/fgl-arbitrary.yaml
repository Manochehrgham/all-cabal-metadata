synopsis: QuickCheck support for fgl
changelog: ! "0.2.0.1\n-------\n\n* Dependency bump\n\n0.2.0.0\n-------\n\n* Properly
  set the version of fgl required: it needs some of the newer\n  functions present
  in 5.5.2.0 (which was not yet released when\n  version 0.1.0.0 of this library was
  released).\n\n* Allow partial application of the `SimpleGraph` type.\n\n* The `Connected`
  wrapper has changed, and the constructor is now\n  exported.\n\n0.1.0.0\n-------\n\n*
  Initial release\n"

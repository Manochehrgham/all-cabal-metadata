synopsis: QuickCheck support for fgl
changelog: ! "0.2.0.0\n-------\n\n* Properly set the version of fgl required: it needs
  some of the newer\n  functions present in 5.5.2.0 (which was not yet released when\n
  \ version 0.1.0.0 of this library was released).\n\n* Allow partial application
  of the `SimpleGraph` type.\n\n* The `Connected` wrapper has changed, and the constructor
  is now\n  exported.\n\n0.1.0.0\n-------\n\n* Initial release\n"

description: ! 'Provides Arbitrary instances for fgl graphs (to avoid adding a

  QuickCheck dependency for fgl whilst still making the instances

  available to others).

  graph-like data structures.'

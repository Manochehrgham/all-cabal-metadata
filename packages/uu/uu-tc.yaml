description: ! 'Course software for INFOB3TC (Languages & Compilers)


  This library currently contains three Haskell 98 parser combinator libraries.


  * The default library, available as @ParseLib@ or more explicitly

  by importing @ParseLib.Simple@, is the one described in the

  lecture notes, using a type synonym as the type for parsers.


  * The second library can be chosen by importing @ParseLib.Abstract@.

  It defines the same functions as @ParseLib.Simple@, but keeps

  the parser type abstract.

  * The third library is an implementation of Koen Claessen''s

  /Parallel Parsing Processes/, available as @ParseLib.Parallel@.


  In future versions of this package, more libraries with more

  advanced implementations of parser combinators may be added.'

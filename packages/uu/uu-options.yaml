description: ! 'Using the new Control.Applicative.Interleaved module we use the uu-parsinglib
  library to construct extremely concise command line processors, which provide

  helpful information when called incorrectly.


  The module contains a module `OptionsDemo` which serves as an example of how to
  use the various options of the module; you may take a look at the source code.


  The package also installs the program `demo-options`

  which may be called from the command line to see what happens for the various options.
  It also contains a function demo which may be called from within ghci to experiment.

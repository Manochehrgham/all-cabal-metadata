description: ! 'This library extends @uuid@ with tools to encode and decode Universally

  Unique Identifiers in the little-endian-ish encoding, which was popularized

  by Microsoft.


  Some systems, for instance UEFI, chose to use this odd format instead of

  the simple encoding specified in RFC 4122.'

description: ! 'This module contains parser library independent code which can be
  used to describe inlerleaved execution of applicative style structures.

  It is amongst other used in the uu-options package, which provides facilities for
  parsing command-line options or files containing preferences.

  It generalises the permuting parsers and the list merging parsers as e.g. found
  in the uulib library. For  a more complete description see the Technical Report

  describing its implementation and use see http://www.cs.uu.nl/research/techreps/UU-CS-2013-005.html'

description: ! 'AERN-RnToRm provides

  datatypes and abstractions for approximating functions

  of type @D -> R^m@ where @D@ is a bounded interval in @R^n@

  with non-empty interior.


  The main datatype are function enclosures whose boundaries are

  piece-wise polynomial with a bounded degree.  (This degree can

  be set arbitrarily high or as low as 0.)

  This datatype is supported by safely rounding operations

  whose precision can be increased arbitrarily, so that they

  all converge to the exact operations.

  Field operations, integration, maximisation and some elementary operations

  (namely exp, sin, cos) are among those already implemented.


  For an architectural overview, see module "Data.Number.ER.RnToRm".


  A mathematical description of the very basics as well as a brief comparison

  with Taylor Models is included in the

  paper <http://www-users.aston.ac.uk/~konecnym/papers/cfv08.html>.


  Simple examples of usage can be found in folder @examples@

  and a test suite can be run via the module in the folder @tests@.'

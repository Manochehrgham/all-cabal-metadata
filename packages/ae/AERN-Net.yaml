description: ! 'AERN-Net provides

  datatypes and abstractions for defining and executing

  networks of communicating processes.  These networks have a fixed

  topology, which can be infinite via recursion.

  The communication on each channel is driven by

  some query-response protocol.  Basic protocols

  for communicating approximations of real numbers and

  functions are provided together with protocol combinators

  eg for communicating value pairs or lists

  and communicating with additional query parameters

  or with optimised repetitions.


  An class-based abstraction is provided to make it possible

  to execute networks on various distributed backends without modification.

  At the moment there is only one backend, which is not distributed.

  It is envisaged that truly distributed backends will be added soon,

  eg based on plain TCP, MPI or REST/SOAP Web services.


  A mathematical foundation of these networks is described

  in the draft

  paper <http://www-users.aston.ac.uk/~konecnym/papers/ernets08-draft.html>.


  Simple examples of usage can be found in modules @DemoMax@ and @DemoSqrt@

  in folder @examples@.'

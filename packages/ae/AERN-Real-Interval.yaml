description: ! 'A concrete implementation for the refinement-order type classes from
  AERN-Real in the form

  of interval arithmetic.  The arithmetic supports also anti-consistent

  intervals (ie @[l,r]@ with @l >= r@) and maintains monotonicity in the

  refinement order so that both inner and outer approximations of exact interval

  expressions can be safely computed.


  The package AERN-Real-Double makes it possible to use ordinary

  machine ''Double'' values as endpoints, although limited to its fixed granularity
  (ie precision).


  A package AERN-Real-MPFR will be provided in future to facilitate (via package hmpfr)

  the use of the MPFR arbitrary granularity (ie precision) floating point numbers

  as endpoints.


  This package does not compile with ghc 7.0.* due to a

  compiler bug that has been fixed for the 7.2.1 release.

  Haddock documentation can be found via <http://code.google.com/p/aern/wiki/Main>.'

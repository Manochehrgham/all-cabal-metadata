description: ! 'A JSON pretty-printing library compatible with aeson as well as

  a command-line tool to improve readabilty of streams of JSON data.


  The /library/ provides the function "encodePretty". It is a drop-in

  replacement for aeson''s "encode" function, producing JSON-ByteStrings for

  human readers.


  The /command-line tool/ reads JSON from stdin and writes prettified JSON

  to stdout. It also offers a complementary "compact"-mode, essentially the

  opposite of pretty-printing. If you specify @-flib-only@ like this


  > cabal install -flib-only aeson-pretty


  the command-line tool will NOT be installed.'

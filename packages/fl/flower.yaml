description: ! 'flower - FLOWgram ExtractoR tools


  This is now obsolete, please install the biosff library

  (which includes the ''flower'' exectuable) instead.


  The flower executable reads files in SFF-format and produces various output,

  including sequences with quality, or flowgram data in tabular format.  By default,

  it outputs a textual representation of the data in the SFF-file, much like

  ''sffinfo'' from Roche does.


  The flowselect executable extracts reads from SFF-files, generating a new

  SFF-file with a subset of the reads based on various quality criteria.


  The flowt program removes (artificial) duplicates from SFF files.  It''s currently
  a work

  in progress, but included if you''d like to play with it.  It''s faster than other
  approaches

  (e.g. CD-HIT), and ought to be more sensitive and specific, but this needs to be
  proven.'

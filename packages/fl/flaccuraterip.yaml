description: ! '/flAccurateRip/ is a command line tool to verify the accuracy of FLAC
  files

  ripped from CD, using the information contained in the AccurateRip™ database

  about other rips of the same CD.


  Usage: suppose you ripped a CD into @track01.flac@, @track02.flac@, ...,

  @trackNN.flac@. Open a shell in the directory containing the FLAC files, and

  run:


  >$ flaccuraterip track01.flac track02.flac ... trackNN.flac


  If a pressing of this CD is present in the AccurateRip™ database,

  @flaccuraterip@ will output the ripping accuracy for each track. If the CD was

  ripped without setting the drive offset, you should use the flag

  @--with-sample-offset=N@, where N is the offset indicated in

  <http://accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm> for your drive.'

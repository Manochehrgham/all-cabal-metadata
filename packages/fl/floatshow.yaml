description: ! 'The String representations provided by this package

  are generally longer than show''s output, which constructs

  the shortest string that is parsed as the original

  number by read. This requires some time-consuming checks,

  so show is slow for floating-point numbers. By producing

  a digit-string guaranteed to be long enough to uniquely

  determine the number without caring whether there''s a

  shorter representation, the display functions of this

  package can be faster, sometimes by a big margin.

  Text.FShow.Raw provides building blocks for representations

  of numeric types which don''t belong to RealFloat but have

  some of its functionality.

  The bulk of the code is a minor modification of code from

  the base package, whence the GHC License is included as

  an extra-source-file.'

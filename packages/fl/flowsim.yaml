description: ! 'Provides clonesim, a clone simulator that simulates shotgun

  genomic clones, and flowsim, that takes the output from clonesim

  (or any other Fasta-formatted file) and generates simulated

  reads from them mimicing Roche''s 454 pyrosequencing technology,

  writing output in 454''s native SFF format.  The flowgram

  generation is based on empirical distributions derived from real

  data (although analytic distributions are available too, if you

  prefer).


  The Darcs repository is at <http://malde.org/~ketil/biohaskell/flowsim>.'

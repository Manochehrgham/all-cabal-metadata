description: ! "Fltkhs - A Haskell Binding to the FLTK GUI Library\n=============================================\n\nFltkhs
  aims to be a complete Haskell binding to the [FLTK GUI library] [1].\n\nAbbreviated
  installation instructions are for Linux and Mac are:\n\n- Download [FLTK 1.3.3]
  [2].\n- Install with:\n```\n    > ./configure\n    > make\n    > make install\n```\n\n-
  Clone and install this repo:\n```\n    > git clone https://github.com/deech/fltkhs\n
  \   cabal install\n```\n\n- Test your installation by invoking: 'fltkhs-arc'.\n\nThe
  rest of the documentation (including installation instructions for Windows and API
  usage) is located in the [FLTKHS module] [3]. This is the primary module that needs
  to be imported by every Fltkhs app and the entry point into the application.\n\n\n

description: ! "Fltkhs - A Haskell Binding to the FLTK GUI Library\n=============================================\n\nFltkhs
  aims to be a complete Haskell binding to the [FLTK GUI library] [1].\n\nThe rest
  of the documentation (including installation instructions and usage) is located
  in\nsrc/Examples/Graphics/UI/LowLevel/FLTK/FLTKHS.hs. This is the primary module
  that needs to be\nimported by every Fltkhs app and the entry point into the application.\n\nThis
  package does not yet install on Windows.\n\nAbbreviated installation instructions
  are reproduced here:\n\n- Download [FLTK 1.3.3] [2].\n- Install with:\n```\n    >
  ./configure\n    > make\n    > make install\n```\n\n- Clone and install this repo:\n```\n
  \   > git clone https://github.com/deech/fltkhs\n    cabal install\n```\n\n- Test
  your installation by invoking: 'fltkhs-hello-world'.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.fltk.org/index.php

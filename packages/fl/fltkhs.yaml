description: ! "Fltkhs - A Haskell Binding to the FLTK GUI Library\n=============================================\n\nFltkhs
  aims to be a complete Haskell binding to the [FLTK GUI library] [1].\n\nNOTE: As
  of version 0.4.0.0, due to the introduction of closed type families, only GHC >=
  7.8.1 is supported.\n\nAbbreviated installation instructions are for Linux and Mac
  are:\n\n- Download [FLTK 1.3.3] [2].\n- Install with:\n```\n    > ./configure --enable-shared\n
  \   > make\n    > make install\n```\n\n- Clone and install this repo:\n```\n    >
  git clone https://github.com/deech/fltkhs\n    cabal install\n```\n\n- Test your
  installation by invoking: 'fltkhs-buttons'.\n\nThe rest of the documentation (including
  installation instructions for Windows and API usage) is located in the [FLTKHS module]
  [3]. This is the primary module that needs to be imported by every Fltkhs app and
  the entry point into the application.\n\nA number of demos are also available in
  the [fltkhs-demos] [4] and the [fltkhs-fluid-examples] [5] packages.\n\n  [1]: http://www.fltk.org/index.php

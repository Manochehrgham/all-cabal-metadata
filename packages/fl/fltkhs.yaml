description: ! "Fltkhs - A Haskell Binding to the FLTK GUI Library\n=============================================\n\nFltkhs
  aims to be a complete Haskell binding to the [FLTK GUI library] [1].\n\nNOTE: As
  of version 0.4.0.0, due to the introduction of closed type families, only GHC >=
  7.8.1 is supported.\n\nAbbreviated installation instructions are for Linux and Mac
  are:\n\n- Download [FLTK 1.3.3] [2].\n- Install with:\n```\n    > ./configure --enable-shared\n
  \   > make\n    > make install\n```\n\n- Install via the `fltkhs-hello-world` skeleton
  application:\n```\n    > git clone https://github.com/deech/fltkhs-hello-world\n
  \   > cd fltkhs-hello-world\n    > stack build\n```\n\n- Test your installation
  by invoking: 'stack exec fltkhs-hello-world'.\n\nThe rest of the documentation (including
  installation instructions for Windows and API usage) is located in the [FLTKHS module]
  [3]. This is the primary module that needs to be imported by every Fltkhs app and
  the entry point into the application.\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n[Drawing with
  FLTKHS](images/arc-windows.png)\n\n[A table of widgets](images/widget-table.png)\n\n[A
  complex tree](images/tree-complex-windows.png) Done completely using Fluid. Notice
  how tree nodes can be arbitrary widgets.\n\nDemos\n-----\nA number of demos are
  also available in the [fltkhs-demos] [4] and the [fltkhs-fluid-demos] [5] packages.\n\n

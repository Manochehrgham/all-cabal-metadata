description: ! 'This package provides (very) low level bindings to libsass. It uses
  libsass

  compiled to static library, so if you use this in your project, you have to

  link your project with C++ runtime(which libsass does automatically - links

  with libstdc++).

  For documentation visit <https://github.com/sass/libsass>.'

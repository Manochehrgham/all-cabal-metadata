description: ! 'Closed frequent itemsets are patterns that occur more

  than a defined threshold in a transactional database.

  This program is a Haskell implementation of the LCM2

  algorithm by Takeaki Uno and Hiroki Arimura, which

  is the fastest algorithm for this task.

  This implementation can make use of several threads.'

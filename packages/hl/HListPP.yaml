description: ! 'A preprocessor that replaces @`longDescriptiveName@ with


  > hLens'' (Label :: Label "longDescriptiveName")


  Use with ghc flags @-F -pgmF HListPP@, which can

  be added per-file with a pragma:


  > ❴-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF HListPP #-❵ -- change braces to ascii (haddock doesn''t
  allow literal comments in files)


  Note that @`labels@ is expanded to something that

  takes up about 26 more columns. To avoid issues with

  layout, put a newline after keywords that introduce

  layout, at least if there are @`labels@ in the same row.

  In other words:


  > `character.`position.`x %= \ x -> let

  >      msg = "a really long message about x>0"

  >      pos = x - 5

  >    in if pos < 0

  >          then error msg

  >          else pos


  Instead of


  > `character.`position.`x %= \ x -> let msg = "a really long message about x>0"

  >                                       pos = x - 5

  >                            in if pos < 0

  >                                then error msg

  >                                else pos


  A blank library is included in this package to make

  it possible to depend on HListPP'

description: ! 'Haskell bindings to Nocedal''s 3.0 version

  of the Limited memory - Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno - Bounded

  optimization algorithm.


  Initial version, but functional. So far no support for limiting iteration

  count. A more powerful interface should be developed.


  Notice: The fortran code is marked pure, althugh it tends to write

  to standard output at troubled times (should be fixed at some point in time).


  From homepage:

  Software for Large-scale Bound-constrained Optimization L-BFGS-B is a

  limited-memory quasi-Newton code for bound-constrained optimization, i.e.

  for problems where the only constraints are of the form l <= x <= u. The

  current release is version 3.0. The distribution file was last changed on

  2011-08-02.'

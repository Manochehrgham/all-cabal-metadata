synopsis: Curses-style user interface for the hledger accounting tool
changelog: ! "User-visible changes in hledger-ui.\nSee also hledger's change log.\n\n0.27.4
  (2016/5/19)\n\n- ensure we have the Show instance for functions, needed since regex-tdfa
  1.2.2\n\n0.27.3 (2016/1/12)\n\n- allow brick 0.4\n\n0.27.2 (2016/1/11)\n\n- allow
  brick 0.3.x\n\n0.27.1 (2015/12/3)\n\n- allow lens 4.13\n- make reloading work on
  the transaction screen\n\n\n0.27 (2015/10/30)\n\n- hledger-ui is a new curses-style
  UI, intended to be a standard part\n  of the hledger toolset for all users (except
  on native MS Windows,\n  where the vty lib is not yet supported).\n\n    The UI
  is quite simple, allowing just browsing of accounts and\n  transactions, but it
  has a number of improvements over the old\n  hledger-vty, which it replaces:\n\n
  \   - adapts to screen size\n    - handles wide characters\n    - shows multi-commodity
  amounts on one line\n    - manages cursor and scroll position better\n    - allows
  depth adjustment\n    - allows --flat toggle\n    - allows --cleared toggle\n    -
  allows journal reloading\n    - shows a more useful transaction register, like hledger-web\n
  \   - offers multiple color themes\n    - includes some built-in help\n\n    hledger-ui
  is built with brick, a new higher-level UI library based\n  on vty, making it relatively
  easy to grow and maintain.\n"

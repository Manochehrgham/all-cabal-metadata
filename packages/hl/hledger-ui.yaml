synopsis: Curses-style user interface for the hledger accounting tool
changelog: ! "User-visible changes in hledger-ui.\nSee also hledger's change log.\n\n0.27.1
  (2015/12/3)\n\n- allow lens 4.13\n- make reloading work on the transaction screen\n\n\n0.27
  (2015/10/30)\n\n- hledger-ui is a new curses-style UI, intended to be a standard
  part\n  of the hledger toolset for all users (except on native MS Windows,\n  where
  the vty lib is not yet supported).\n\n    The UI is quite simple, allowing just
  browsing of accounts and\n  transactions, but it has a number of improvements over
  the old\n  hledger-vty, which it replaces:\n\n    - adapts to screen size\n    -
  handles wide characters\n    - shows multi-commodity amounts on one line\n    -
  manages cursor and scroll position better\n    - allows depth adjustment\n    -
  allows --flat toggle\n    - allows --cleared toggle\n    - allows journal reloading\n
  \   - shows a more useful transaction register, like hledger-web\n    - offers multiple
  color themes\n    - includes some built-in help\n\n    hledger-ui is built with
  brick, a new higher-level UI library based\n  on vty, making it relatively easy
  to grow and maintain.\n"

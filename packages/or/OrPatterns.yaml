description: ! 'A quasiquoter for or-patterns. It allows one additional

  form for patterns:


  > f [o| p1 | p2 | p3 |] = rhs


  Above, @p1@, @p2@ and @p3@ are three arbitrary patterns

  that bind the same variables. These variables are

  available in the expression @rhs@. Nesting of or-patterns

  is not supported yet.


  See also:


  * http://hackage.haskell.org/package/first-class-patterns

  supports @\\\/@ (or). However, variables bound with

  those patterns are not named. This means:


  > g :: Either (x, y) (y, x) -> (x, y)

  > g [o| Left (x,y) | Right (y,x) |] = (x,y)


  > -- ends up slightly longer

  > g = elim $ left (pair var var) \/ right flipped ->> (,)

  >  where

  >   flipped = (\(a,b) -> (b,a)) --> pair var var


  * http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3919

  is the feature request for or-patterns in ghc'

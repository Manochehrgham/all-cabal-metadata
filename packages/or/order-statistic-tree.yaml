description: ! 'This repository contains an implementation of order statistic tree
  in Haskell programming language.

  I could not find an order statistic tree at Hackage, so I have to develop one.


  This implementation uses weight-balanced trees which are desribed in


  - Hirai, Yoichi, and Kazuhiko Yamamoto. "Balancing weight-balanced trees." Journal
  of Functional Programming 21.03 (2011): 287-307.


  Also some code is based on containers package.


  Implementation of order statistic tree is described in


  - Cormen, T.H., Leiserson, Rivest, Stein. Introduction to algorithms. The MIT Press.
  3rd ed.


  = Benchmarks


  I tried to make this tree as fast as possible. The results on my i7-4790 with 16Gb
  RAM are following:


  - OSTree was created from 1.000.000 random numbers in 2.087 ± 0.021 s (e.g. for
  Data.Map.Strict - 1.977 ± 0.016 s);

  - deletion from OSTree with 1.000.000 random numbers was made in 13.94 ± 0.93 ms;

  - lookup from OSTree with 1.000.000 random numbers was made in 208.2 ± 3.48 ns;

  - selection from OSTree with 1.000.000 random numbers was made in 92.72 ± 1.91 ns;

  - full testing protocol can be found in result-bench.txt.'

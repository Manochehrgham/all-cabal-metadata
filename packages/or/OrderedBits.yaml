description: ! 'This library provides efficient methods to enumerate all

  elements of a set in order of the population count. First, the

  empty set, then all 1-element sets, all 2-element sets, etc.

  Such enumerations are important for algorithms over unordered

  data sets. Examples include the travelling salesman problem and

  the closely related Hamiltonian path problem.'

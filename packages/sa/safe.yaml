description: ! 'A library wrapping @Prelude@/@Data.List@ functions that can throw
  exceptions, such as @head@ and @!!@.

  Each unsafe function has up to four variants, e.g. with @tail@:


  * @tail :: [a] -> [a]@, raises an error on @tail []@.


  * @tailMay :: [a] -> /Maybe/ [a]@, turns errors into @Nothing@.


  * @tailDef :: /[a]/ -> [a] -> [a]@, takes a default to return on errors.


  * @tailNote :: /String/ -> [a] -> [a]@, takes an extra argument which supplements
  the error message.


  * @tailSafe :: [a] -> [a]@, returns some sensible default if possible, @[]@ in the
  case of @tail@.


  This package is divided into three modules:


  * "Safe" contains safe variants of @Prelude@ and @Data.List@ functions.


  * "Safe.Foldable" contains safe variants of @Foldable@ functions.


  * "Safe.Exact" creates crashing versions of functions like @zip@ (errors if the
  lists are not equal) and @take@ (errors if there are not enough elements), then
  wraps them to provide safe variants.'

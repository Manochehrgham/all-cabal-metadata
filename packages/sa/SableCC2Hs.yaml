description: ! 'This package allows one to use parsers that were written for the SableCC

  parser generator from Haskell and Prolog.

  More specifically it reads an XML file that is generated by SableCC

  (version sablecc-3-beta.3.altgen.20041114.zip)

  and generates Haskell and Prolog modules which contain the parser tables.

  The package is used in the build-process of the the ProB Animator

  (http://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/ProB) to build parsers for the B specification
  language

  and it is primarily interesting for ProB developers.

  Nevertheless, there are several SableCC grammars available on the Internet

  (http://sablecc.org/wiki/GrammarPage) and in case someone ever has to use one of
  those grammars

  with Haskell (for whatever reason), then this package might be useful.

  As this package is still under development,

  it does not contain the actual parser-engines that execute the generated parser-tables.

  For an example of a runnable B-Parser, based on this tool, look at the ProB source-code
  (Prolog)

  or the B-Frontend package (Haskell).

  Any questions of feedback well-come.'

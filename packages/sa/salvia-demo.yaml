description: ! 'This package contains six simple example programs that show how to
  use the

  Salvia web application framework. The first demo, /salvia-demo/, contains a

  bigger example showing off some of the more advanced features and handler

  running on the default Salvia server implementation. The second demo,

  /salvia-cgi/ show how to switch the Salvia back-end and run a Salvia handler

  in CGI mode. The third example, /salvia-serve/, is a simple file server that

  uses the /c10k-server/ back-end and the /send-file/ package to server static

  files and directories. The other demos illustrate how to use some simple

  aspects of the web framework.'

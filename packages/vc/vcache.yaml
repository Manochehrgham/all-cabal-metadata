description: ! 'VCache provides a nearly-transparent persistent memory for Haskell

  supporting ACID transactional variables and large structured values.

  The virtual address space is modeled above a memory mapped file via

  LMDB, with structure sharing and incremental reference counting GC.


  VCache was developed as an alternative to acid-state in a context where

  the persistent data is much bigger than the active working set and RAM.

  Other similar packages include TCache and perdure. See the home page

  for a simple comparison.'

description: ! 'VCache supports larger-than-memory values with caching, persistence,

  and structure sharing. Effective use of VCache requires useful data

  structures be modeled above it. The trie is useful for modeling key

  value databases or abstract virtual filesystems, where keys have

  shared prefixes or elements with a common prefix are likely to be

  updated together.


  Currently, the implementation is specialized to a bytestring trie.'

synopsis: A tool for testing command-line programs.
changelog: ! "1.3.5 (2014/3/30)\n\n  * fix Applicative warning with ghc 7.10\n  *
  allow utf8-string <1.1\n\n1.3.4 (2014/5/28)\n\n  * drop cabal-file-th, support GHC
  7.8.2\n\n1.3.3 (2014/5/25)\n\n  * allow process 1.2, regex-tdfa-1.2\n  * add a hackage-compatible
  changelog\n\n1.3.2 (2013/11/13)\n\n  * increase upper bound on Diff package\n\n1.3.1
  (2012/12/28)\n\n  * fix cabal file typo breaking the build\n\n1.3 (2012/12/28)\n\n
  \ * support latest Diff, cmdargs, test-framework; tested with GHC 7.6.1 (Magnus
  Therning)\n\n  * fix unicode handling on GHC >= 7.2\n\n1.2.1 (2012/3/12)\n\n  *
  use the more up-to-date filemanip package for easier Debian packaging\n\n1.2 (2012/2/26)\n\n
  \ * support latest cmdargs, test-framework, and GHC 7.4\n  * more readable non-quoted
  failure output by default; for quoted output, use -p/--precise\n  * the --all, --diff
  and --precise options now interact well\n\n1.1 (2011/8/25)\n\n  * bump process dependency
  to allow building with GHC 7.2.1\n  * new -a/--all flag shows all failure output
  without truncating\n\n1.0 (2011/7/23)\n\n  * New home page/docs\n  * The >>>= field
  is now required; you may need to add it to your existing tests\n  * Input and expected
  output can now contain lines beginning with #\n  * Multiple tests in a file may
  now have whitespace between them\n  * The -i/--implicit option has been dropped\n
  \ * New -d/--diff option shows test failures as a unified diff when possible, including
  line numbers to help locate the problem\n  * New -x/--exclude option skips certain
  test files (eg platform-specific ones)\n  * Passing arguments through to test-framework
  is now more robust\n  * Fixed: parsing could fail when input contained left angle
  brackets\n  * Fixed: some test files generated an extra blank test at the end\n\n0.9
  (2010/9/3)\n\n  * show plain non-ansi output by default, add --color option\n  *
  better handling of non-ascii test data. We assume that non-ascii file\n    paths,
  command-line arguments etc. are UTF-8 encoded on unix systems\n    (cf http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html),\n
  \   and that GHC 6.12 or greater is used. Then:\n    - non-ascii test file paths
  should render correctly, eg in failure messages\n    - non-ascii test commands should
  run correctly\n    - non-ascii expected output should match correctly\n    - non-ascii
  regular expressions should match correctly. (Caveat: not\n      thoroughly tested,
  this may break certain regexps, )\n  * use regex-tdfa instead of pcre-light for
  better windows compatibility\n    To avoid a memory leak in current regex-tdfa,
  only regular expressions\n    up to 300 characters in size are supported. Also,
  DOTALL is no longer\n    enabled and probably fewer regexp constructs are supported.
  \ There are\n    still issues on windows/wine but in theory this will help.\n  *
  tighten up dependencies\n\n0.8 (2010/4/9)\n\n  * rename executable to shelltest.
  The package might also be renamed at some point.\n  * better built-in help\n  *
  shell tests now include a full command line, making them more readable\n    and
  self-contained. The --with option can be used to replace the first\n    word with
  something else, unless the test command line begins with a\n    space.\n  * we also
  accept directory arguments, searching for test files below\n    them, with two new
  options:\n      --execdir        execute tested command in same directory as test
  file\n      --extension=EXT  file extension of test files (default=.test)\n\n0.7
  (2010/3/5)\n\n  * more robust parsing\n    - --debug-parse parses test files and
  stops\n    - regexps now support escaped forward slash (\\/)\n    - bad regexps
  now fail at startup\n    - command-line arguments are required in a test, and may
  be blank\n    - a >>>= is no longer required to separate multiple tests in a file\n
  \   - comments can be appended to delimiter lines\n    - comments can appear at
  end of file\n    - files need not have a final newline\n    - files containing nothing,
  all comments, or valid tests are allowed; anything else is rejected\n    - somewhat
  better errors\n    - allow indented input\n  * support negative (-) and negatively-matched
  (!) numeric exit codes\n  * let . in regexps match newline\n  * warn but continue
  when a test file fails to parse\n  * output cleanups, trim large output\n  * more
  flexible --implicit flag\n  * switch to the more robust and faster pcre-light regexp
  lib\n\n0.6 (2009/7/15)\n\n  * allow multiple tests per file, handle bad executable
  better\n\n0.5 (2009/7/14)\n\n  * show failure output in proper order\n\n0.4 (2009/7/14)\n\n
  \ * run commands in a more robust way to avoid hangs\n    This fixes hanging when
  a command generates large output, and hopefully\n    all other deadlocks. The output
  is consumed strictly. Thanks to Ganesh\n    Sittampalam for his help with this.\n
  \ * --implicit-tests flag providing implicit tests for omitted fields\n  * --debug
  flag\n  * regular expression matching\n  * disallow interspersed foreign options
  which confused parseargs\n  * change comment character to #\n\n0.3 (2009/7/11)\n\n
  \ * misc. bugfixes/improvements\n\n0.2 (2009/7/10)\n\n  * bugfix, build with -threaded\n\n0.1
  (2009/7/10)\n\n  * shelltestrunner, a generic shell command stdout/stderr/exit status

description: ! 'shelltestrunner is a cross-platform tool for testing command-line

  programs (or arbitrary shell commands.)  It reads simple declarative tests

  specifying a command, some input, and the expected output, error output

  and exit status.  Tests can be run selectively, in parallel, with a

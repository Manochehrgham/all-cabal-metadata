description: ! 'In his 1991 dissertation, Olin Shivers introduces a concept

  of control flow graphs for functional languages, provides an algorithm

  to statically derive a safe approximation of the control flow graph and

  proves this algorithm correct. In our student research project,

  Shivers'' algorithms and proofs are formalized using the theorem prover

  system Isabelle.


  This package contains the Haskell prototype of the Isabelle

  formalization, together with some pretty printing and rendering

  facilities. It is provided as a reference, not as a ready-to-use library.'

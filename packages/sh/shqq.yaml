description: ! 'This library provides a quasiquoter for executing shell commands,
  somewhat

  similar to Perl''s backtick operator.  Shell commands are IO actions, and

  they capture the command''s standard output as a @String@ result.


  You can use Haskell variables in a shell command.  A string representation

  of the contents will be interpolated.  The shell will see each interpolated

  variable as a single token without interpreting special characters, unless

  you choose otherwise.


  Note: The shell escaping is not correct for the Windows shell.  This library

  should fail to build on Windows, as well.


  Examples of using this library are included in @examples/@.'

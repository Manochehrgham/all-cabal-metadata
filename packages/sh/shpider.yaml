description: ! 'Shpider is a web automation library for Haskell.   It allows you to
  quickly

  write crawlers, and for simple cases ( like following links ) even without

  reading the page source.


  It has useful features such as turning relative links from a page into

  absolute links, options to authorize transactions only on a given domain,

  and the option to only download html documents.


  It also provides a nice syntax for filling out forms.


  An example:


  > runShpider $ do

  >      download "http://apage.com"

  >      theForm : _ <- getFormsByAction "http://anotherpage.com"

  >      sendForm $ fillOutForm theForm $ pairs $ do

  >            "occupation" =: "unemployed Haskell programmer"

  >            "location" =: "mother''s house"

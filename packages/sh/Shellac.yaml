description: ! 'Shellac is a framework for building read-eval-print style shells.

  Shells are created by declaratively defining a set of shell commands

  and an evaluation function.  Shellac supports multiple shell backends,

  including a ''basic'' backend which uses only Haskell IO primitives and

  a full featured ''readline'' backend based on the the Haskell readline

  bindings found in the standard libraries.

  This library attempts to allow users to write shells at a high level

  and still enjoy the advanced features that may be available from a

  powerful line editing package like readline.'

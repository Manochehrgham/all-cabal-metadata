description: ! 'The shellisg package provides a single module for convenient

  \"systems\" programming in Haskell, similar in spirit to POSIX

  shells or PERL.


  * Elegance and safety is sacrificed for conciseness and

  swiss-army-knife-ness.


  * The interface exported by Shellish is thread-safe.


  Overall, the module should help you to get a job done quickly,

  without getting too dirty.'

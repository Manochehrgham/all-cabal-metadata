description: ! 'This package provides a Shellac backend based on the editline

  library.  editline provides a subset of the functionality

  provided by the GNU readline library.  However, it is licenced

  with a BSD-style license and is therefore suitable for some situations

  where GNU readline is not.  This backend features all the line

  editing capabilities provided by editline.'

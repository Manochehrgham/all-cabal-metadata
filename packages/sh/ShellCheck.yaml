description: ! 'The goals of ShellCheck are:


  * To point out and clarify typical beginner''s syntax issues,

  that causes a shell to give cryptic error messages.


  * To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems,

  that causes a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively.


  * To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls, that may cause an

  advanced user''s otherwise working script to fail under future circumstances.'

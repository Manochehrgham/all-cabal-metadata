description: ! 'This package uses a compile-time, type-safe approach to create translated
  content. It has a simple syntax for translators, while allowing the full power of
  Haskell for applying complex grammar rules.


  This package was spun off from yesod-core, and therefore the Yesod documentation
  is a good place to start in understanding this package. Please see <http://www.yesodweb.com/book/shakespearean-templates>
  for more information.'

synopsis: Link shortcuts for use in text markup
changelog: ! '# 0.3.0.0


  * Added shortcut names to their descriptions.


  # 0.2.0.0


  * Descriptions of shortcuts look much better now.

  * “sublime” was renamed to “sublimepc”, since it''s possible that some other package
  manager for Sublime Text would emerge in the future.

  * Shortcut “tvt” for TV Tropes was removed – it''s just “tvtropes” now.

  * “facebook” can link to profiles by their ID.

  * “tvtropes” properly capitalises names of categories (if given as an option) –
  previously you needed to write e.g. “SugarWiki”, now “sugar wiki” works too.


  # 0.1.0.0


  First release.

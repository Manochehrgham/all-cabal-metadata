description: ! 'Shake is a Haskell library for writing build systems - designed as
  a

  replacement for @make@. See "Development.Shake" for an introduction,

  including an example. Further examples are included in the Cabal tarball,

  under the @Examples@ directory. The homepage contains links to a user

  manual, an academic paper and further information:

  <http://shakebuild.com>


  To use Shake the user writes a Haskell program

  that imports "Development.Shake", defines some build rules, and calls

  the ''Development.Shake.shakeArgs'' function. Thanks to do notation and infix

  operators, a simple Shake build system

  is not too dissimilar from a simple Makefile. However, as build systems

  get more complex, Shake is able to take advantage of the excellent

  abstraction facilities offered by Haskell and easily support much larger

  projects. The Shake library provides all the standard features available in other

  build systems, including automatic parallelism and minimal rebuilds.

  Shake also provides more accurate dependency tracking, including seamless

  support for generated files, and dependencies on system information

  (e.g. compiler version).'

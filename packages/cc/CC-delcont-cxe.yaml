description: ! 'Oleg Kiselyov''s three new monad transformers for multi-prompt delimited
  control

  (released with his permission)


  This library implements the superset of the interface described in

  *   /A Monadic Framework for Delimited Continuations/,

  R. Kent Dybvig, Simon Peyton Jones, and Amr Sabry

  JFP, v17, N6, pp. 687--730, 2007.

  This library''s "Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe" is derived as a CPS version of

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/CC-delcont-exc>''s Control.Monad.CC.CCExc.

  "Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe" is sometimes more efficient; it is always less perspicuous.

  Both libraries provide the identical interface and are interchangeable. It seems

  that CC-delcont-exc''s  Control.Monad.CC.CCExc is faster at delimited control but

  imposes more overhead on the conventional code; "Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe" is dual.

  It pays to use "Control.Monad.CC.CCCxe" in code with long stretches of determinism

  punctuated by fits and restarts.


  See the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>

  for more information.


  This package split multi-prompt delimited control from

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.'

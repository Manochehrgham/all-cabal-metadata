  This library is the most direct implementation of the bubble-up reduction

  semantics of multi-prompt delimited control. The library stands out in not

  being based on the continuation monad. Rather, the monad of "Control.Monad.CC.CCExc"

  is an extension of the ''Error'' monad: a monad for restartable exceptions.

  The library offers not one monad transformer but a family (''CC'' ''p'')

  parameterized by the prompt flavor ''p'' . The library defines several prompt

  flavors; the users are welcome to define their own.


  See the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>

  for more information.


  This package split multi-prompt delimited control from

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.'

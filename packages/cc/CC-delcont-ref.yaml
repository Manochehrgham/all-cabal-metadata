  This library is closest to the interface of Dybvig, Peyton Jones and Sabry.

  "Control.Monad.CC.CCRef" is derived from the definitional interpreter using

  the implementation techniques described and justified in the FLOPS 2010 paper.

  The monad transformer ''CC'' implemented by "Control.Monad.CC.CCRef" requires

  the base monad to support reference cells. In other words, the base monad

  must be a member of the type class ''Mutable'': that is, must be ''IO'', ''ST'',

  ''STM'' or their transformer. "Control.Monad.CC.CCRef" adds to the original

  interface the frequently used function ''abortP'' as a primitive.


  See the original article at <http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#CC-monads>

  for more information.


  This package split multi-prompt delimited control from

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.'

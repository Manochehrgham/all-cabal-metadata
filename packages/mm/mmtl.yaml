description: ! 'A modular monad transformer library, (almost) a drop-in replacement
  for

  the monad transformer library (mtl). It provides a uniform lifting of

  operations through any monad transformer.

  Known differences with mtl:

  - It provides a uniform lifting of operations for

  any monad transformer.

  - It does not provide a RWS monad (but you can build it yourself ;)

  - The class MonadTrans requires a new member function tmap.

  - The lifting of callCC through StateT coincides with

  the lifting in MonadLib, but not with the lifting in mtl.'

description: ! 'This library provides a wrapper to mmap(2) or MapViewOfFile,

  allowing files or devices to be lazily loaded into memory as

  strict or lazy ByteStrings, ForeignPtrs or plain Ptrs, using

  the virtual memory subsystem to do on-demand loading.

  Modifications are also supported.'

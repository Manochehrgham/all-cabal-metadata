synopsis: Configurable Knuth-Liang hyphenation
changelog: ! '0.5

  -----

  * Added support for classic Latin and Georgian. Updated language patterns to match
  `hyph-utf8` version #687 2014-10-13.


  0.4.2.1

  -------

  * `filepath` 1.4 support


  0.4.2

  -----

  * Fixed a typo in .cabal which prevented the `Embed` flag from working properly.


  0.4.1

  -----

  * Added support for embedding all of the pattern files into the library as resources
  by using `cabal install hyphenation -fembed`. This is not the default as it inflates
  the library size by ~3MB and forces all users to pay for all the hyphenation patterns,
  but it can be useful for users who aim to build standalone applications.


  0.4

  ---

  * Removed Farsi. We had no pattern files.


  0.3

  ---

  * Added Friulan, Piedmontese, Romansh and Thai language hyphenations.


  0.2.2

  -----

  * Flagged `Text.Hyphenation.Language` as `Trustworthy`. It has benign side-effects
  that cause it to read hyphenation files lazily from the installed `data-dir` but
  nothing else.

description: ! 'We have made an implementation of the language Lambda-H,

  described in the paper "Hybrid Type Checking" by Cormac Flanagan, which uses a

  hybrid type checking system.

  We have tried to keep our implementation as close as possible to the language

  defined in Flanagan''s paper. The result should be seen as a proof-of-concept,

  and an exercise in implementing a hybrid type checker for a language with

  advanced type specifications.'

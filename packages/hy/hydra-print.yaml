description: ! 'Output from parallel subprocesses is an ugly, many-headed beast.

  Piping though hydra-print provides an NCurses interface to a dynamic

  set output streams, displayed without interleaving.  This is a

  common problem, for example, with parallel compiles, or

  data-processing scripts.


  Specifically, this small library will split the screen when

  parallelism occurs, and unsplit it when the parallelism is

  finished (i.e. dynamically growing and losing \"heads\").

  The @io-streams@ library is used for all stream inputs.'

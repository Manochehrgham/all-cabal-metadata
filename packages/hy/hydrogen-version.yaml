description: ! 'A sane replacement for "Data.Version" from the @base@ package.


  "Hydrogen.Version" is also exported by "Hydrogen.Prelude" where

  it comes with a few more instances (e.g. for "Data.Serialize").


  >>> Differences to Data.Version


  [@Sane ''Ord'' instance@] "Data.Version" relies on ''Ord'' for lists,

  which will consider @1.0@ to be less than @1.0.0@. @Hydrogen.Version@

  considers these to be equal.


  [@Sane ''Read'' and ''Show'' instances@] With @Hydrogen.Version@ you can

  just do @read "1.0.0" :: Version@, whereas the ''Read'' and ''Show''

  instances for "Data.Version" do not give a concise representation:


  > show hydrogenVersion == "1.0.0"

  > show dataVersion == "Version versionBranch = [1,0,0], versionTags = []"


  [@Stricter API@] In @Hydrogen.Version@ you can create a ''Version''

  only via ''mkVersion'', whereas in "Data.Version" the constructor is

  exported, thus you could so such nonsense as

  @Data.Version.Version [] []@ (which is not a proper version at all).


  [@No Tags@] @Hydrogen.Version@ does not support tags. This is

  intentional, since there is no agreed upon definition for ''Ord'' in

  the presence of tags (consider @alpha@ vs @beta@ vs @snapshot@ vs

  @ga@ vs ...).'

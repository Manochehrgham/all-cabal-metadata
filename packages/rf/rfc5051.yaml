description: ! 'This library implements @i;unicode-casemap@,

  the simple, non locale-sensitive unicode collation

  algorithm described in RFC 5051 (<http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5051.txt>).

  Proper unicode collation can be done using text-icu, but that is a big

  dependency that depends on a large C library, and rfc5051 might be better

  for some purposes.


  Here is a list of strings sorted by the Prelude''s @sort@ function:


  @Abe Oeb abe ab&#233; oeb &#193;be &#196;be &#212;eb &#225;be &#228;be &#244;eb@


  Here is the same list sorted by @sortBy compareUnicode@:

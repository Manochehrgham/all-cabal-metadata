description: ! '`pipes` is a clean and powerful stream processing library that lets
  you build

  and connect reusable streaming components


  Advantages over traditional streaming libraries:


  * /Concise API/: Use simple commands like ''for'', (''>->''), ''await'', and ''yield''


  * /Blazing fast/: Implementation tuned for speed, including shortcut fusion


  * /Lightweight Dependency/: @pipes@ is small and compiles very rapidly,

  including dependencies


  * /Elegant semantics/: Use practical category theory


  * /ListT/: Correct implementation of ''ListT'' that interconverts with pipes


  * /Bidirectionality/: Implement duplex channels


  * /Extensive Documentation/: Second to none!


  Import "Pipes" to use the library.


  Read "Pipes.Tutorial" for an extensive tutorial.'

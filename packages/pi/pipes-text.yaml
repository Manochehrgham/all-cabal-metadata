description: ! '* This package will be in a draft, or testing, phase until version
  0.0.1. Please report any installation difficulties, or any wisdom about the api,
  on the github page or the <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskell-pipes
  pipes list>


  This organization of the package follows the rule


  * @pipes-text : pipes-bytestring :: text : bytestring@


  Familiarity with the other three packages should give one an idea what to expect
  where. The package has three modules, @Pipes.Text@ , @Pipes.Text.Encoding@ and @Pipes.Text.IO@;
  the division has more or less the significance it has in the @text@ library.


  Note that the module @Pipes.Text.IO@ is present as a convenience (as is @Data.Text.IO@).  Official
  pipes IO would use @Pipes.ByteString@ together with the bytestring decoding functions
  in @Pipes.Text.Encoding@.  In particular, the @Pipes.Text.IO@ functions use Text
  exceptions.


  @Pipes.Text.IO@ uses version 0.11.3 or later of the @text@ library. It thus works
  with the version of @text@ that came with the 2013 Haskell Platform. To use an older
  @text@, install with the flag @-fnoio@'

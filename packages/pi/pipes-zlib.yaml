synopsis: Zlib and GZip compression and decompression for Pipes streams
changelog: ! "# Version 0.4.4\n\n* Depend on `streaming-commons` instead of `zlib`
  and `zlib-bindings`,\n  as the latter are deprecated.\n\n* Add `Pipes.Zlib.decompress'`
  and `Pipes.GZip.decompress'`.\n\n* Bump upper bound dependency on `transformers`.\n\n*
  Add tests.\n\n# Version 0.4.3\n\n* Fix usage of the `Producer'` type synonym (#14).\n\n\n#
  Version 0.4.2.1\n\n* Fix “Codec.Compression.Zlib: premature end of compressed stream”
  (#13)\n\n\n# Version 0.4.2\n\n* Added the `Pipes/GZip.hs` file that was missing
  in 0.4.1.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.1\n\n* Added `Pipes.GZip` module.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0.1\n\n*
  Bump upper bound dependency on `transformers`.\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0\n\n* Backwards
  incompatible API. `compress` and `decompress` are now\n  functions of `Producer'`s
  as they need to perform actions at the\n  beginning and end of input. (Issue #3)\n\n\n#
  Version 0.3.1\n\n* Dependency upper bounds.\n\n\n# Version 0.3.0\n\n* Upgraded to
  work with pipes-4.0.0, creating a new backwards\n  incompatible API.\n\n* Generalize
  base `IO` monad to `MonadIO`.\n\n\n# Version 0.2.0.0\n\n* New backwards incompatible
  API.\n\n* Based on pipes-3.3 and zlib-bindings.\n\n\n# Up to version 0.1.0\n\n*
  Based on pipes-core and zlib-bindings.\n"

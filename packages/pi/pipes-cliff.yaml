description: ! 'pipes-cliff helps you spawn subprocesses and send data to and

  from them with the Pipes library.

  Subprocesses are opened using the

  process library, and you stream data in and out using the various

  Pipes abstractions.


  Though this library uses the Pipes library, I have not coordinated

  with the author of the Pipes library in any way.  Any bugs or design

  flaws are mine and should be reported to


  <http://www.github.com/massysett/pipes-cliff/issues>


  For more information, see the README.md file, which is located in the

  source tarball and at

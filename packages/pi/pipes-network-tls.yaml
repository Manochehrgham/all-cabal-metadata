description: ! 'Use TLS-secured network connections together with the @pipes@ ecosystem.


  This package is organized using the following namespaces:


  * "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS" exports pipes and utilities for using

  TLS-secured TCP connections in a streaming fashion.


  * "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS.Safe" subsumes "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS",

  exporting pipes and functions that allow you to safely establish new

  TCP connections within a pipeline using the @pipes-safe@ facilities.

  You only need to use this module if you want to acquire and release

  operating system resources within a pipeline.


  See the @changelog@ file in the source distribution to learn about any

  important changes between version.'

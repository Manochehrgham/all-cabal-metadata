description: ! "## Whats in this library?\n\nA pair of fold-like datatypes that consume\n[Producers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.1.7/docs/Pipes.html#t:Producer)\nfrom
  [pipes](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) and can be constructed\nin a variety
  of ways, in particular from the more versatile folds in Gabriel\nGonzalez's [foldl](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/foldl)
  package.\n\nThe **Fold1** consumes a single **Producer**, while the **Fold2** datatype\nconsumes
  two **Producer**s concurrently.\n\n## Why was this library created?\n\nI wanted
  a fold-like datatype for IO-based Producers that let me perform\n\"bracketing\"
  operations (the folds in foldl are push-based and do not allow\nthat). \n\nI also
  wanted to be able to fold two Producers concurrently (for example, take\nthe piped
  stdout & stderr streams of an external process and merge the lines\ninto a single
  file as they are produced).\n\nFinally, I wanted the fold-like datatype to have
  a \"failure value\" baked in.\n\nIf you don't need any of that, you are better off
  using **pipes** and/or\n**foldl** by themselves. \n\n## Where can I find working
  examples for this library?\n\nThere are none yet.\n"

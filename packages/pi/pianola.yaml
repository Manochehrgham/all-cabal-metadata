description: ! 'This is a library for remotely controlling

  Java Swing desktop applications that have been

  instrumented with a special pianola agent.

  The agent exposes the Swing component hierarchy

  over the network, and accepts requests for

  generating GUI events. The library handles the

  interaction on the Haskell side.'

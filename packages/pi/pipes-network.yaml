description: ! 'Use network sockets together with the @pipes@ library.


  This package is organized using the following namespaces:


  * "Pipes.Network.TCP" exports pipes and utilities for using TCP connections in

  a streaming fashion.


  * "Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe" subsumes "Pipes.Network.TCP", exporting pipes and

  functions that allow you to safely establish new TCP connections within a

  pipeline using the @pipes-safe@ facilities. You only need to use this module

  if you want to safely acquire and release operating system resources within a

  pipeline.


  See the @changelog@ file in the source distribution to learn about any

  important changes between version.'

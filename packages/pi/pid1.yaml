description: ! "## pid1\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/pid1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/pid1)\n\nDo
  signal handling and orphan reaping for Unix PID1 init processes.\n\nThis provides
  a Haskell library, and an executable based on that library, for\ninitializing signal
  handlers, spawning and child process, and reaping orphan\nprocesses. These are the
  responsibilities that must be fulfilled by the initial\nprocess in a Unix system,
  and in particular comes up when running Docker\ncontainers.\n\nThis library/executable
  will automatically detect if it is run as some process\nbesides PID1 and, if so,
  use a straightforward `exec` system call instead.\n\n__NOTE__ This package is decidedly
  _not_ portable, and will not work on\nWindows. If you have a use case where you
  think it makes sense to run on\nWindows, I'd be interested in hearing about it.\n\nFor
  a discussion on why this is useful, see [this\nrepo](https://github.com/snoyberg/docker-testing#readme).\n\n###
  Usage\n\nThe recommended use case for this executable is to embed it in a Docker
  image.\nAssuming you've placed it at `/sbin/pid1`, the two commonly recommended
  usages\nare:\n\n1. Override the entrypoint, either via `ENTRYPOINT` in your Dockerfile
  or\n   `--entrypoint` on the command line.\n\n   ```\n   docker run --rm --entrypoint
  /sbin/pid1 fpco/pid1 ps\n   ```\n\n2. Add `/sbin/pid1` to the beginning of your
  command.\n\n   ```\n   docker run --rm --entrypoint /usr/bin/env fpco/pid1 /sbin/pid1
  ps\n   ```\n"

description: ! "## pid1\n\nDo signal handling and orphan reaping for Unix PID1 init
  processes.\n\nThis provides a Haskell library, and an executable based on that library,
  for\ninitializing signal handlers, spawning and child process, and reaping orphan\nprocesses.
  These are the responsibilities that must be fulfilled by the initial\nprocess in
  a Unix system, and in particular comes up when running Docker\ncontainers.\n\nThis
  library/executable will automatically detect if it is run as some process\nbesides
  PID1 and, if so, use a straightforward `exec` system call instead.\n\n__NOTE__ This
  package is decidedly _not_ portable, and will not work on\nWindows. If you have
  a use case where you think it makes sense to run on\nWindows, I'd be interested
  in hearing about it.\n\nBlog post on some of the finer points here expected in the
  future.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe recommended use case for this executable is to embed
  it in a Docker image.\nAssuming you've placed it at `/sbin/pid1`, the two commonly
  recommended usages\nare:\n\n1. Override the entrypoint, either via `ENTRYPOINT`
  in your Dockerfile or\n   `--entrypoint` on the command line.\n\n   ```\n   docker
  run --rm --entrypoint /sbin/pid1 fpco/pid1 ps\n   ```\n\n2. Add `/sbin/pid1` to
  the beginning of your command.\n\n   ```\n   docker run --rm --entrypoint /usr/bin/env
  fpco/pid1 /sbin/pid1 ps\n   ```\n"

description: ! 'PiSigma is a small dependently typed language with only very few

  constructs: Type:Type, Pi-types, Sigma-types, enumerations and a

  general meachanism for mutual recursion for types and values

  controlled by lifted types. It is intended as a core language for

  dependently typed languages like Agda. It has been described in the

  paper <em>PiSigma: Dependent Types Without the Sugar</em> which has

  appeared in the proceedings of FLOPS 2010.'

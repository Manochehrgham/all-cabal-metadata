description: ! 'This package provides a pure interface for compressing and

  decompressing streams of data represented as lazy @ByteString@s. A

  monadic incremental interface is provided as well. This package

  relies on the @liblzma@ C library.


  The following packages are based on this package and provide

  API support for popular streaming frameworks:


  * </package/lzma-streams lzma-streams> (for </package/io-streams io-streams>)

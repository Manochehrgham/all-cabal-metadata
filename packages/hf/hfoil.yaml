description: ! 'Library and command line REPL with plotting to do simple inviscid
  hess-smith panel code.


  Features include:


  * Cheap and shameless xfoil ripoff for relp/plotting interface


  * Naca 4-series support with Gauss-Newton paneling


  * Broken UIUC database integration (type \"uiuc [foilname]\")


  * Haskeline interface with tab-completion (oooh)


  * Single and multi-element airfoils


  * Inviscid, incompressible, 2-dimensional flow only



  To get started, do cabal install or whatever, then run the \"hfoil\" binary.


  Things to try: \"naca 2412\", \"alfa 4\", (hit enter before entering another airfoil),
  \"load [filename]\", \"uiuc e330\"'

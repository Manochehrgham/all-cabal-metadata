description: ! 'This package provides a generic interfaces for working

  with And-Inverter graphs (AIGs) in Haskell.  And-Inverter graphs

  are a useful format for representing combinatorial and

  sequential boolean circuits in a way that is amenable to

  simulation and analysis.

  These interfaces allow clients to write code that can create

  and use AIGs without depending on a particular AIG package.'

description: ! 'This package complements the Aivika and Aivika Experiment packages
  with

  charting capabilites. Now the simulation results can be represented

  as charts.


  Nevertheless, to plot the charts, you hould use one of the rendering backends

  provided by packages Aivika Experiment Cairo or Aivika Experiment Diagrams.

  While the Cairo backend suits mostly to Linux and partially OS X, the Diagrams

  backend is mainly destined for MS Windows, although it should work on Linux

  and OS X too.

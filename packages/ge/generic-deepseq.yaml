description: ! 'This package provides a ''deepseq'' function analogous to ''seq'',
  except that it

  traverses the entire data structure, evaluating it fully, and not just up to

  head normal form.


  Using lists as an example:


  > > [1,2,undefined] `seq` 3

  > 3


  Whereas with ''deepseq'':


  > > [1,2,undefined] `deepseq` 3

  > *** Exception: Prelude.undefined


  Unlike the @deepseq@ package, this implementation is based on the

  "GHC.Generics" framework as found in GHC >= 7.2, so that it can generate

  instances automatically for any datatype that has a ''Generic'' instance,

  without further code.


  > data MyType = MyType String Int (Maybe Double)

  >   deriving Generic

  > instance DeepSeq MyType


  Changes in version 2.0.0.0:


  * Vastly improved performance. As a consequence of these changes, the member function
  of the DeepSeq class is now ''rnf'', instead of ''deepseq''.


  * New instances for functions, Ratio and Complex types.


  Changes in version 2.0.1.0:


  * Fix the U1 and V1 instances.


  Changes in version 2.0.1.1:


  * No functional changes, updated to correct the URLs of the repository and the issue
  tracker.'

description: ! 'A library to support the definition of generic functions.

  Datatypes are viewed in a uniform, structured way:

  the choice between constructors is represented using an n-ary

  sum, and the arguments of each constructor are represented using

  an n-ary product.


  The module "Generics.SOP" is the main module of this library and contains

  more detailed documentation.


  Examples of using this library are provided by the following

  packages:


  * @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/basic-sop basic-sop>@ basic examples,


  * @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pretty-sop pretty-sop>@ generic pretty printing,


  * @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-sop lens-sop>@ generically computed
  lenses,


  * @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-sop json-sop>@ generic JSON conversions.


  A detailed description of the ideas behind this library is provided by

  the paper:


  * Edsko de Vries and Andres LÃ¶h.

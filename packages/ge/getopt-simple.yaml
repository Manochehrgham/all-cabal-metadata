description: There's no need to invoke full 'getOpt' power in everyday use. So, here
  it is a most common use case implemented to be as painless as possible while retaining
  some functionality. It's divided into three layers, each built upon another. You
  can start at highest and peel of layers to gradually unlock more 'getOpt' features.

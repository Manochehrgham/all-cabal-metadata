description: ! 'GenericSerialize is a library for serialization using the

  existing generic-programming framework.


  It is often advocated that support for serialization should be added to

  the compiler (e.g. in the form of a deriving(Binary)).  With this I

  intend to show that the existing infrastructure is sufficient, and

  has some advantages over a dedicated serialization interface.


  The main advantage that generic serialization posseses is that it is

  possible to simultaneously have several serialization modes.  While

  interfaces such as AltBinary allow writing to any type of stream, the

  data format is fixed.  By contrast, GenericSerialize supports multiple

  serialization modes; while the only currently existing module is for a

  subset of R5RS s-expressions, that module is less than 100 lines of code

  and is almost pure grammar.'

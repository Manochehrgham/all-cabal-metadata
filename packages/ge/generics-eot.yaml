description: ! '`generics-eot` is a library for datatype generic programming that
  tries to be

  very simple to understand and use. It''s heavily inspired by the awesome

  `generics-sop` package (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop).


  There''s documentation in the source code, there''s a tutorial in

  `Generics.Eot.Tutorial` and there''s also some examples in `examples` (and

  descriptive tests for them in `test/Examples`).

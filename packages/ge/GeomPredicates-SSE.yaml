description: ! 'Exact, hardware based computation of geometric predicates using an
  SSE based interval filter and the ESSA algorithm.

  See \"Exact computation of Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation\" by Marina
  Gavrilova, Helmut Ratschek and Jon Rokne.

  This package is a specialization of the @GeomPredicates@ package and uses it''s
  primitives defined under @Numeric.Geometric.Primitives@.

  This package requires a CPU with @Streaming SIMD Extensions 2@.'

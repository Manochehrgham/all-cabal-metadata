description: ! 'Easy to use JSON parser fully supporting incremental parsing.

  Parsing grammar in applicative form.

  The parser is compatibile with aeson and its FromJSON class.

  It is possible to use aeson monadic parsing when appropriate.

  The parser supports constant-space safe incremental parsing regardless

  of the input data. In addition to performance-critical parts written in C,

  a lot of performance is gained by being less memory intensive especially

  when used for stream parsing.'

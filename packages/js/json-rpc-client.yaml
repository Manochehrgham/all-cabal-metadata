description: ! 'Functions for creating a JSON-RPC 2.0 client.  See

  <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>. This library supports

  batch requests and notifications, as well as single method

  calls.  It also provides a function for creating corresponding

  server-side methods with the package

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-rpc-server json-rpc-server>.

  This library does not handle transport, so a function for

  communicating with the server must be provided.

  The demo folder contains an example client and server that can

  be compiled with the demo flag.  See "Network.JsonRpc.Client"

  for details.'

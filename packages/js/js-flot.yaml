description: ! 'This package bundles the minified <http://www.flotcharts.org/ Flot>
  code

  (a jQuery plotting library) into a Haskell package,

  so it can be depended upon by Cabal packages. The first three components of

  the version number match the upstream flot version. The package is designed

  to meet the redistribution requirements of downstream users (e.g. Debian).'

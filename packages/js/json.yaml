description: ! 'JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange

  format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for

  machines to parse and generate.  It is based on a subset of the

  JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition -

  December 1999.


  This library provides a parser and pretty printer for converting

  between Haskell values and JSON.'

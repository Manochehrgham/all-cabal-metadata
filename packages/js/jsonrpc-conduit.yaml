description: ! '@jsonrpc-conduit@ implements the basic building block of a JSON-RPC
  2.0 server.


  It provides a @Conduit@ that consumes RPC requests and invokes user-provided

  functions to handle them. Conversion of values to and from JSON is almost

  completely automatic thanks to the @aeson@ library.


  The JSON-RPC conduit is generic with respect to the channel used to exchange

  data with the client. It can use a network connection or, for example,

  the standard input / ouput  of a process. The latter is demonstrated by the

  @jsonrpc-conduit-demo@ executable, which can be compiled using the @demo@ flag.'

description: ! 'Given an address of a server sharing a set of functions,

  this rpc library generates functions of the same name for

  a client, preformed within the IO monad.  Calling

  these results in the original function being executed

  server side.  The pseudo-functions generated maintain

  their original server side type (except for the added IO).'

description: RPM is a decent system for listing dependencies among packages.  In its
  simplest form it works quite well.  Dependency management can become troublesome
  if you have a system that provides numerous packages.  Worse yet, if you provide
  many packages for many different versions of a software application.  This library
  aims to provide a rich set of combinators to assert the validity of a collection
  of RPMs.

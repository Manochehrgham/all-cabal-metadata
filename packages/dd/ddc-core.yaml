description: ! 'Disciple Core is an explicitly typed language based on System-F2,
  intended

  as an intermediate representation for a compiler. In addition to the polymorphism
  of

  System-F2 it supports region, effect and closure typing. Evaluation order is

  left-to-right call-by-value by default. There is a capability system to track whether

  objects are mutable or constant, and to ensure that computations that perform visible

  side effects are not reordered inappropriately.

  See the @ddc-tools@ package for a user-facing interpreter and compiler.'

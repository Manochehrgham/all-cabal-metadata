description: ! 'CSV files are the de-facto standard in many situations involving data
  transfer,

  particularly when dealing with enterprise application or disparate database

  systems.


  While there are a number of CSV libraries in Haskell, at the time of this

  project''s start in 2010, there wasn''t one that provided all of the following:


  * Full flexibility in quote characters, separators, input/output


  * Constant space operation


  * Robust parsing, correctness and error resiliency


  * Convenient interface that supports a variety of use cases


  * Fast operation


  This library is an attempt to close these gaps.


  For more documentation and examples, check out the README at:


  <http://github.com/ozataman/csv-enumerator>


  The API is fairly well documented and I would encourage you to keep your

  haddocks handy. If you run into problems, just email me or holler over at

  #haskell.'

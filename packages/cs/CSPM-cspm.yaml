description: ! 'cspm is a small command line tool for analyzing CSPM specifications.

  It supports serveral modes of operation.

  For example as:


  * ''cspm --help''      -> print a help message.


  * ''cspm eval ''3+4''''  -> evaluate an expression.


  * ''cspm trace spec.csp'' -> interactively trace a process.


  * ''cspm assert spec.csp'' -> check the assertions of a specification (only some
  assertions are supported).


  * ''cspm lts spec.csp --dotOut spec.csp.dot'' -> compute the labeled transition
  system of a process and dump it as dot-file.


  * ''cspm lts spec.csp --fdrOut spec.csp.fdr''   -> compute the LTS

  and dump it a fdr script suitable for refinement checking.


  cspm is not a full featured FDR replacement.

  The main purpose of cspm is to show how the different CSPM-packages work together.

  LTS computation can demonstrate nice speed-ups on multi-core machines.

  Try for example ''cspm +RTS -N7 -RTS fdr spec.csp'' to use 7 cores.'

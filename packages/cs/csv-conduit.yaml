description: ! 'CSV files are the de-facto standard in many situations involving data
  transfer,

  particularly when dealing with enterprise application or disparate database

  systems.


  While there are a number of CSV libraries in Haskell, at the time of this

  project''s start in 2010, there wasn''t one that provided all of the following:


  * Full flexibility in quote characters, separators, input/output


  * Constant space operation


  * Robust parsing, correctness and error resiliency


  * Convenient interface that supports a variety of use cases


  * Fast operation


  This library is an attempt to close these gaps. Please note that

  this library started its life based on the enumerator package and

  has recently been ported to work with conduits instead. In the

  process, it has been greatly simplified thanks to the modular nature

  of the conduits library.


  Following the port to conduits, the library has also gained the

  ability to parameterize on the stream type and work both with

  ByteString and Text.

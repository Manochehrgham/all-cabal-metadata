description: ! 'This package contains functions for computing the transitions of a
  CSP process

  based on the standard CSP firing rule semantic

  (see The Theory and Practice of Concurrency A.W. Roscoe 1999.)

  It also contains a rudimentary tracer for executing transitions,

  some QuickCheck tests, and a data type for proof trees.

  To use this package one has to provide instances for the classes and type families,

  defined in the CSPM-CoreLanguage package.

  The package contains two mock-implementations that provide these instances.

  The CSPM-Interpreter package contains an other implementation.'

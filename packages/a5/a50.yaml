description: ! 'a50 - a simple tool for graphing genome coverage and fragmentation.


  Reads files of contigs, and compares them by plotting each as a line in a graph.

  The x-axis represents contig number, the y-axis represents total (cumulative) size.

  An ideal assembly contains a few, large contigs, thus this curve should rise steeply,
  and

  stop early (but at the expected genome size).  Conversely, a poor assembly consisting
  of

  many small fragments will have a less steep curve extending far to the right.


  The graphs produced by a50 gives a simple and easy to grasp comparison between assemblies,

  and yet produces a more detailed and informative view than the usual metrics like
  largest

  contig size or N50.

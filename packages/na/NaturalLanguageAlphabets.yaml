description: ! 'Provides different encoding for characters and words in natural

  language processing. A character will often be encoded as a

  unicode text string as we deal with multi-symbol characters.


  Internal encoding of IMMC symbols are 0-based integers, which

  allows for the use of unboxed containers.


  A very simple unigram-based scoring scheme is also provided.'

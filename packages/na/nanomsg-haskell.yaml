description: ! 'This is a Haskell binding for the nanomsg library: <http://nanomsg.org/>.

  There''s support for (evented) blocking send and recv, a non-blocking receive,

  and for all the socket types and the functions you need to wire

  them up and tear them down again.

  Most sockets options are available through accessor and mutator

  functions. Sockets are typed, transports are not.

  The module Nanomsg.Binary provides a simple Binary based serialization

  layer over send and receive.'

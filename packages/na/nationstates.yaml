description: ! "# NationStates for Haskell [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/lfairy/nationstates.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lfairy/nationstates)\n\n[NationStates]
  is an online government simulation game, created by Max Barry. The site generates
  a wealth of data, some of which can be accessed through its [official API].\n\nThis
  library lets you query this API using the Haskell programming language.\n\n[NationStates]:
  https://nationstates.net\n[official API]: https://www.nationstates.net/pages/api.html\n\n\n##
  Features\n\n* **Type safe**: you can't refer to a shard unless you explicitly request
  it.\n\n* **Automatic rate limiting**, which can be disabled or overridden if you
  want.\n\n* **HTTP support** via the [tls] library.\n\n* **Free and open source**

  Dependencies\n\n* GHC 7.6 or newer\n\n\n## Installation\n\n`nationstates` is hosted
  on [Hackage].\n\n    cabal install nationstates\n\n[Hackage]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nationstates\n\n\n##
  Example\n\n```haskell\nimport NationStates\nimport qualified NationStates.Nation
  as Nation\nimport Text.Printf\n\nmain = withContext \"ExampleBot/2000\" $ \\c ->
  do\n    (name, motto) <- Nation.run \"Montesardo-East Adanzi\" shards c\n    printf
  \"%s has the motto: %s\\n\" name motto\n  where\n    shards = (,) <$> Nation.name

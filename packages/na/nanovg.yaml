description: ! '# NanoVG Haskell bindings


  Currently only the GL3 backend is supported.


  A large part of the example bundled with

  [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) is translated into

  Haskell and bundled as `example00`.


  Most of the bindings directly expose the corresponding

  [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) so look there for more

  details on the usage.


  There is also a [diagrams backend](https://github.com/cocreature/diagrams-nanovg)
  using these bindings.


  Feel free to open issues if you have any ideas for improvements (or even better
  PRs :)).

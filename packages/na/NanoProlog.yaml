description: ! 'This package was developed to demonstrate the ideas behind

  the Prolog language. It contains a very small interpreter

  (@Language.Prolog.Nanoprolog@) which can be run on its

  own. It reads a file with definitions, and then prompts

  for a goal. All possibe solutions are printed, preceded by

  a tree showing which rules were applied in which order.


  The file @royals.pro@ contains a description of part of the Dutch royal family,
  whereas the file

  @tc.pro@ shows unification at work in a very small type inferencer.'

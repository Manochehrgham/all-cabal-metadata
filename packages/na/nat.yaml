description: ! 'Implementation of natural numbers and integers by a

  binary representation. All functions are supposed to

  be as non-strict as possible. Furthermore the

  implementation is supposed to be reasonable efficient

  (in comparison to peano numbers). This implementation

  is inspired by a similar approach in the functional

  logic programming language Curry.'

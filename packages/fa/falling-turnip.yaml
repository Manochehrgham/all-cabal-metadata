description: ! 'Falling Turnip is an interactive particle simulation. Like others
  in the same genre (typically dubbed "falling sand games"), it has some degree of
  approximation for gravity, fluid flow and alchemical reactions. Unlike the others,
  it is based entirely on cellular automata and runs in parallel.

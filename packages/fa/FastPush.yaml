description: ! 'This library gives you a monad that lets you push things onto a stack
  very quickly.

  You get things off the stack when you run the monad. Under the hood, this uses mutable

  vectors. I''ve also included a monad transformer using the STMonadTrans library
  that

  does the same thing as a transformer, but it''s probably very unsafe.'

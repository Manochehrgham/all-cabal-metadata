description: ! 'This package provides bindings to the farmhash library.


  FarmHash is a family of very fast hash functions (see

  <https://code.google.com/p/farmhash/>). They are not suitable for

  cryptography.


  This package bundles the library with it so there are no external

  dependencies.'

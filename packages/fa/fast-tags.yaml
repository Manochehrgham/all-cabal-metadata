description: ! 'Yet another tags program.  Like hasktags, it uses its own parser rather

  than haskell-src or haskell-src-exts, so it''s fast.  It understands

  hsc and literate haskell.


  In addition, it will load an existing tags file and merge generated tags.


  The intent is to bind it to vim''s BufWrite autocommand to automatically

  keep the tags file up to date.  This only works for files changed by the

  editor of course, so you may want to bind ''rm tags'' to a ''pull'' posthook.


  Limitations:


  - Not using a real haskell parser means there is likely to be dark

  corners that don''t parse right.


  - Code has to be indented \"properly\", so brace and semicolon style with

  strange dedents will probably confuse it.'

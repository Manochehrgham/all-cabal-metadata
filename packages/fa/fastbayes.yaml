description: General-purpose sampling approaches like Gibbs sampling are very useful
  for models that have not been studied extensively. But for some cases, specialized
  algorithms are available because of the model's commonality (/e.g./, linear regression)
  or niche popularity (/e.g./, Latent Dirichlet Allocation). This package is an effort
  to collect such algorithms in one place.

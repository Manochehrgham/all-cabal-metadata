description: ! 'The repa-image library adds support for reading and

  writing images in many formats based on the DevIL

  open source image library. Image data is represented in Haskell

  as typed, multi-dimensional repa arrays.


  Developer\''s Image Library (DevIL) is a library to

  develop applications with very powerful image

  loading capabilities, yet with a relatively simple

  interface. DevIL can load, save, convert,

  manipulate, filter and display a wide variety of

  image formats, including:


  * BMP, ICO, JPG, PNG, PNM, TGA, TIF, GIF, EXIF and many more.

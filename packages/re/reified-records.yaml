description: ! 'This package provides a series of functions to do introspect records
  and allow records to be manipulated

  dynamically as @Map@s.

  Currently this works using @Data.Data@ however in future this will likely change
  to @GHC.Generics@ and allow more user hooks

  into how types are reified and reflected.'

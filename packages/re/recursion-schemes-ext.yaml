description: ! '# recursion-schemes-ext


  This adds several functions to

  [recursion-schemes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes-5.0.2),

  including a `cataM`.


  At the moment, you should be careful using functions from this package. While

  APIs will likely be stable, they may occasionally be wrong.

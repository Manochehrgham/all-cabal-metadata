  -- which depends on the older, more rudimentary, libsdl-1 specific

  [SDL to Haskell bindings](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/SDL) and a pre-1.0
  version of the

  [reactive-banana library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reactive-banana).

  It has been ported to the use Oliver Charles'' [sdl2](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sdl2)
  library

  and the > 1.0 releases of Reactive Banana.

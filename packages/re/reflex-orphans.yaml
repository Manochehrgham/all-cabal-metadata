description: ! 'This package provides additional instances missing from <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflex
  reflex>, specificly ''Functor'' and ''Applicative'' for ''Dynamic''. The inclusion
  of these instances facilitates easier, conventional Haskell style programming in
  reflex.


  The performance of these instances carries a 2x coefficient in the best case, and
  considerations for the multiplicative complexity when nesting have not been implemented.'

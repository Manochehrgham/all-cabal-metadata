description: ! 'A quasiquoter for Text.Regex.PCRE regexes.

  This makes use of a new GHC extension known as QuasiQuotes.

  QuasiQuotes do not appear in ghc until 6.9, BUT there is a

  patch for ghc-6.8.3 which adds quasiquote functionality. A

  patched version of ghc-6.8.3, made possible by audreyt''s patch, is at

  <http://code.haskell.org/~morrow/quasiquotes/ghc-6.8.3_QQ-0.2.tar.bz2>.

  An example of the use of @regexqq@ is located at

  <http://code.haskell.org/~morrow/quasiquotes/regexqq.txt>.

  Haddock docs are at

  <http://code.haskell.org/~morrow/quasiquotes/regexqq/docs/>.'

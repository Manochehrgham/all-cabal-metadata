description: ! 'This library is intended to be a public playground for

  developing infrastructure, higher level APIs, and widget

  libraries for reflex FRP applications. This library is

  experimental and does not have a strong commitment to

  preserving backwards compatibility. It will not have a

  high bar for the quality of contributions. That being

  said, we prefer commits that add new things rather than

  changing existing ones. If you are wondering if there is

  some convenience code or abstractions and you don''t find

  them in reflex or reflex-dom, look here and see if anyone

  has already done it. If you have general-purpose reflex

  code that you find useful that is not already here, add

  it to this repository and send us a pull request.'

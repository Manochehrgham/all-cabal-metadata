description: ! 'This package contains a module that can be used in web applications.
  It''s use

  cases are only limited by the use of blaze for the markup of pages. If anynoe

  cares to abstract that away, I would not stand in the way.


  This package also contains an executable that uses the dyre library to allow

  a configuration of a web application in the way xmonad or yi does. An examle

  can be fount in the ''RBB'' module.


  The blog contents are managed via a version control system. The filestore

  library has been used as a backend for this and hence the supported

  repository types mainly depend on the filestore version used. Thes currently

  suppored repository types are git, mercurial and darcs. The entries are

  rendered using the pandoc library.


  For more information see the haddock documentation of the exported modules or

  the README.md included in this package.'

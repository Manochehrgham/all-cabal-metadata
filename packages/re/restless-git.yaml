description: ! 'This package defines a simple way to serialize state as a nested file

  hierarchy saved in a Git repository.

  It is still quite inflexible, and rather slow because it repeatedly

  invokes Git''s plumbing commands.

  It used to be implemented with libgit2, but I found it desirable to

  avoid FFI.

  Any way to make it faster without FFI would be great.'

description: ! '# regex-pcre-text


  This package extends regex-base and `regex-pcre` to work with `Text`

  in the same way that `regex-tdfa-text` does. It uses the `regex-base`

  `Text` instances provided by `regex-tdfa-text`.



  ## usage with regex


  To use it with `regex` just make sure you are using `regex-with-pcre`

  `1.0.1.0` or later.



  ## credits


  This code is based on the code for `regex-pcre` by Christopher Kuklewicz.

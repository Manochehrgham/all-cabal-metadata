description: ! 'The library allows you to allocate memory in a region yielding a

  regional pointer to it. When the region terminates all pointers

  are automatically freed. Most importantly, a pointer can''t be

  returned from the region. So it''s impossible to reference

  unallocated memory.


  The primary technique used in this package is called \"Lightweight

  monadic regions\" which was invented by Oleg Kiselyov and

  Chung-chieh Shan. See:


  <http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight>


  This technique is implemented in the @regions@ package which is

  re-exported from this library.


  This library provides wrappers around all the @Ptr@ functions

  from the @Foreign.*@ modules of the @base@ library.'

description: ! 'Reenact is a reimplementation of the /Reactive/ library by Conal Elliott.

  It preserves semantics and most operators of the original library. In

  particular the ''Monoid'', ''Applicative'' and ''Monad'' instances for

  ''Events'', ''Reactives'' and ''Behaviours'' are available and have the original
  semantics.

  The implementation however is completely different, based on asynchronous

  channels instead of the ''unamb'' operator.'

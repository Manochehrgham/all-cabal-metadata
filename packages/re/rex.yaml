description: ! 'Provides a quasi-quoter for regular expressions which

  yields a tuple, of appropriate arity and types,

  representing the results of the captures.  Allows the user

  to specify parsers for captures as inline Haskell.  Can

  also be used to provide typeful pattern matching in

  function definitions and pattern matches.  Also, it

  precompiles the regular expressions into a PCRE

  compiled byte-array representation, at compile time.'

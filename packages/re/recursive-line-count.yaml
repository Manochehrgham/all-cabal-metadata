description: ! 'This program can be used to count lines of code in a program and display

  them hierarchically.  For example, to tally up lines of Haskell code in a

  git repository:


  >git ls-files ''*.hs'' | recursive-line-count


  More precisely, @recursive-line-count@ takes a list of file names on

  standard input, counts lines in each file, and displays the results in a

  GtkTreeView.


  Note that although this package is BSD3-licensed, it has LGPL dependencies.'

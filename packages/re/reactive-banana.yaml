description: ! 'Reactive-banana is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).


  FRP offers an elegant and concise way to express interactive programs such as graphical
  user interfaces, animations, computer music or robot controllers. It promises to
  avoid the spaghetti code that is all too common in traditional approaches to GUI
  programming.


  See the project homepage <http://wiki.haskell.org/Reactive-banana>

  for more detailed documentation and examples.


  /Stability forecast:/


  No semantic bugs expected.


  Significant API changes are likely in future versions,

  though the main interface is beginning to stabilize.


  The library features an efficient, push-driven implementation

  and has seen some optimization work.

  However, the inner loop still has a rather large constant factor overhead.

  Moreover, there is currently /no/ garbage collection for events that are

  created dynamically with @Reactive.Banana.Switch@.'

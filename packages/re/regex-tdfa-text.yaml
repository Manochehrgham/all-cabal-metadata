description: ! 'This provides text interface for regex-tdfa.


  This should be part of regex-tdfa package. But my patches are not accepted yet.

  So, I made a separate package. If you are interested in my patches, see

  <http://hub.darcs.net/shelarcy/regex-base> and <http://hub.darcs.net/shelarcy/regex-tdfa>.'

description: ! 'This package provides a set of functions for creating and playing
  continuous animations of the form Time -> a.

  Finite animations (with a length) and infinite animations complement one another,
  we chose a representation of

  finite animations which has only a length (and not a starting point) to keep things
  simple. If needed such animations

  can be converted to infinite animations, combined, and clipped as required.'

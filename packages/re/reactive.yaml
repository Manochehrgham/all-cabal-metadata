description: ! '/Reactive/ is a simple foundation for programming reactive systems

  functionally.  Like Fran\/FRP, it has a notions of (reactive) behaviors and

  events.  Unlike most previous FRP implementations, Reactive has a hybrid

  demand/data-driven implementation, as described in the paper \"Push-pull

  functional reactive programming\", <http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/>.


  This version of Reactive has some serious bugs that show up particularly

  with some uses of the Event monad.  Some problems have been due to bugs

  in the GHC run-time support for concurrency.  I do not know whether the

  remaining problems in Reactive are still more subtle RTS issues, or

  some subtle laziness bugs in Reactive.  Help probing the remaining

  difficulties is most welcome.


  Import "FRP.Reactive" for FRP client apps.  To make a Reactive adapter for an

  imperative library, import "FRP.Reactive.LegacyAdapters".

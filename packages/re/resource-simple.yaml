description: ! 'This is a simplified, standalone version of the @ResourceT@ transformer
  that

  was originally developed as part of the @conduit@ package. That version of

  @ResourceT@ was supported by a complicated hierarchy of type classes, the

  main purpose of which was to enable the usage of @ResourceT@ on top of the

  @ST@ monad. However, this doesn''t really make much sense conceptually, and

  the reason it was done is because conduits are very closely tied to

  @ResourceT@, and an instance for @ST@ would enable the usage of @ResourceT@

  in pure code.


  This package completely does away with the supporting type class hierarchy,

  and as such, this version of @ResourceT@ can only be used with @IO@ or

  @IO@-like monads.


  This package is motivated by a belief that the iteratee problem and the

  resource finalization problem are orthogonal. This package is ideal for

  usage with the @pipes@ library.'

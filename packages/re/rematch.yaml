description: ! 'Rematch is a simple library of matchers, which express rules

  that can pass or fail. Matchers also report their failure with

  human readable output. Custom matchers can be build, and

  matchers can be combined using several predefined combinators

  or you can write your own.

  Matchers are often used in automated tests to provide expressive

  failure messages.

  Rematch is very similar to, and very inspired by the hamcrest

  library for Java'

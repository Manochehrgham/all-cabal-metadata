description: ! 'This package exposes combinators that can wrap arbitrary

  monadic actions. They run the action and potentially retry

  running it with some configurable delay for a configurable

  number of times.

  The purpose is to make it easier to work with IO and

  especially network IO actions that often experience temporary

  failure and warrant retrying of the original action. For

  example, a database query may time out for a while, in which

  case we should hang back for a bit and retry the query instead

  of simply raising an exception.'

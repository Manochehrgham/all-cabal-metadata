description: ! 'This package provides the region monad transformer. Scarce resources
  like

  files, memory pointers or USB devices for example can be opened in a

  region. When the region terminates, all opened resources will be automatically

  closed. The main advantage of regions is that the opened resources can not be

  returned from the region which ensures no I/O with closed resources is

  possible.


  The primary technique used in this package is called \"Lightweight monadic

  regions\" which was invented by Oleg Kiselyov and Chung-chieh Shan.  See:


  <http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/regions.html#light-weight>


  Also see the @regions-mtl@ and @regions-monadstf@ packages which provide

  instances for the classes in the respected monad transformers packages.


  For an example on how to use this library see the @safer-file-handles@,

  @usb-safe@ or @regional-pointers@ packages.'

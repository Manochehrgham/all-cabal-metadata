description: ! 'This package provides a flexible record system which has some novel
  features:


  * Using record type families, the type system can be used to describe relationships

  between field types.


  * Record scheme induction permits the implementation of polymorphic record

  combinators that work on whole records instead of only a fixed set of fields.


  * Subkind polymorphism for sorts makes it possible to impose varying restrictions
  on

  the structure of field types.


  For detailed information, please refer to the paper

  /Generic Record Combinators with Static Type Checking/.'

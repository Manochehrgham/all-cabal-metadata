description: ! 'An alternate implementation of push-pull FRP. This is based on the
  Reactive package (http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/reactive) (and the sources have
  been made available in accordance with the GPL [license] of that package).


  Known problems with this version:


  * The UI library tends to freeze after a few seconds of use. Don''t know whether
  the problem is semantical or a deadlock. The core library works correctly though.


  * There seems to be a speed problem that I can''t identify, but it doesn''t appear
  to be fundamental.


  * UI library is currently on Windows only, but there are plans....'

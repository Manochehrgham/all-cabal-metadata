description: ! 'This is a library for reifying Haskell data structures in GHC.

  Haskell values are mapped into representations that we call

  graphs (for want of a better name). The representations are

  encoded in the Haskell type Graph, which is just an ordinary

  algebraic data type. This will not reify functions.


  Bitrotten.'

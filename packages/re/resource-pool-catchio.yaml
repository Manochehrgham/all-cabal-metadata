description: ! 'This is a fork of Bryan O''Sullivan''s resource-pool package. The
  only

  difference is that it relies on MonadCatchIO, rather than MonadControlIO. If

  you do not strictly need the MonadCatchIO support, please use Bryan''s

  original package instead.

  A high-performance striped pooling abstraction for managing

  flexibly-sized collections of resources such as database

  connections.'

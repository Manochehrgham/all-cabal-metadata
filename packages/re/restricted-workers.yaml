description: ! 'This library provides an abstract interface for

  running various kinds of workers under resource

  restrictions. It was originally developed as part

  of the interactive-diagrams

  (<http://github.com/co-dan/interactive-diagrams>)

  project. To read more about the idia behind the

  library check out my GSoC report:

  <http://parenz.wordpress.com/2013/07/15/interactive-diagrams-gsoc-progress-report/>.


  The library provides a convenient way of running worker processes,

  saving data obtained by the workers at start-up, a simple pool

  abstraction and a configurable security and resource limitations.

  Please consult

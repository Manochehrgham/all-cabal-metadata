description: ! 'Relative-date provides two modules.  Data.Duration gives

  functions for the creation of durations of time, represented

  as functions from DateTime to DateTime.  Data.DateTime.Parser

  presents miscellaneous parsers for handling time descriptions

  of varying levels of detail.  The library also can parse

  descriptions of repeated times, returning a (possibly infinite)

  list of DateTimes.'

description: ! 'readline package is a good wrapping library around libreadline.


  Unfortunately, there is a lot of set/get pairs of functions, which clutter namespace.

  This kind of API can be nicely expressed as StateVars, as in HOpenGL.


  readline-statevar seeks to fill this gap and provide nicer API based on StateVars.


  For clarity: this module wraps only System.Console.Readline module.

  System.Console.SimpleLineEditor is left untouched.'

description: ! 'Automatically type-check SQL statements at compile time.

  Uses Template Haskell and the raw PostgreSQL protocol to describe SQL statements
  at compile time and provide appropriate type marshalling for both parameters and
  results.

  Allows not only syntax verification of your SQL but also full type safety between
  your SQL and Haskell.

  Supports many built-in PostgreSQL types already, including arrays and ranges, and
  can be easily extended in user code to support any other types.

  Originally based on Chris Forno''s templatepg library.'

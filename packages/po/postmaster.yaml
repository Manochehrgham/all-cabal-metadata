description: ! 'Postmaster implements an ESMTP server. Given a configuration,

  it starts up and listens for incoming SMTP connections, handles

  them, and pipes the accepted e-mail messages into an arbitrary

  local mailer of your choice. A good local mailer is Procmail.

  Beyond that, you can configure and modify every little step

  of the SMTP transaction. All the real work is done through

  call-back functions.'

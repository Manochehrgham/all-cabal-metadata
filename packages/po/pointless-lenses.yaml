description: ! 'Pointless Lenses is library of bidirectional lenses (<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/newlenses-popl.pdf>)
  defined in the point-free style of programming.

  Generic bidirectional lenses can be defined over inductive types by relying in a
  set of lifted lens combinators from the standard point-free combinators.

  Recursive lenses can be defined by combining the lenses for the recursion patterns
  of catamorphisms and anamorphism.

  More refined lens behavior can be achieved a more operation-based variant of delta-lenses
  (<>).

  The library also provides QuickCheck procedures to test the well-behavedness of
  user-defined lens transformations.

  More details can be found in the accompanying papers <http://alfa.di.uminho.pt/~hpacheco/publications/mpc10.pdf>
  and <http://alfa.di.uminho.pt/~hpacheco/publications/hdlenses.pdf>'

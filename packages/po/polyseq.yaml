description: ! 'Given a term, this program calculates a set of \"optimal\" free theorems

  that hold in a lambda calculus with selective strictness. It omits

  totality (in general, bottom-reflection) and other restrictions when

  possible. The underlying theory is described in the paper \"Taming

  Selective Strictness\" (ATPS''09) by Daniel Seidel and Janis Voigtl√§nder.'

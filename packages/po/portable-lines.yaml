synopsis: Alternative 'lines' implementation that understands CR-LF and CR

description: ! 'Provides an alternative implementation of the ''Prelude.lines'' function
  that

  treats the following sequences as newline characters:


  * @\"\\r\\n\"@ (Windows style)


  * @\"\\r\"@ (Macintosh style, before OS X)


  * @\"\\n\"@ (Unix style)


  Haskell''s IO system supports both platform-specific line ending conversion

  (by opening the file in \"text mode\"), and explicit setting of the newline

  mode for input and output (see ''System.IO.hSetNewlineMode'').  However:


  * If you don''t know the line ending format in advance, you would have to

  open the file and detect the newline format manually.


  * ByteString currently honors neither of these; see

  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6837628>.'

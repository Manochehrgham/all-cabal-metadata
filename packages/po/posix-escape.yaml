description: ! 'This library provides functions to wrap a @String@ so it can be used

  within a Unix shell command line, and end up as a single argument

  to the program invoked.


  The module @System.Posix.Escape@ is the safer option.  The module

  @System.Posix.Escape.Unicode@ has extra caveats which are documented

  with that module.


  There is a similar function within the @process@ package as

  @System.Process.Internals.translate@.'

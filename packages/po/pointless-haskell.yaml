description: ! 'Pointless Haskell is library for point-free programming with recursion
  patterns defined as hylomorphisms, inspired in ideas from the PolyP library.

  Generic recursion patterns can be expressed for recursive types and no support for
  mutually recursive types or nested data types is provided.

  The library also features the visualization of the intermediate data structure of
  hylomorphisms with GHood (<http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/GHood>).'

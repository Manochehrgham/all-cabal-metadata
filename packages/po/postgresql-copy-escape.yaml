description: ! 'In PostgreSQL, the @COPY@ statement [1] provides a fast way to perform
  bulk

  insertion and retrieval.  To use @COPY ... FROM@ for bulk insertion, the

  data must first be converted to a special CSV-like format.


  This package provides basic support for converting data to the format

  needed by @COPY ... FROM@.  However, it does not provide the inverse

  operation (namely, reading data produced by @COPY ... TO@), nor does it

  support formatting customizations (what delimiter to use, how to represent

  NULL, etc.).

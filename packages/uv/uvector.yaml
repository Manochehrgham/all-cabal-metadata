description: ! 'Fast unboxed arrays with a flexible interface.

  The library is built of fusible combinators, as

  described in the paper /Stream Fusion: From Lists to

  Streams to Nothing at All/.


  For best results, compile with your user programs

  with -O2 -fvia-C -optc-O3.


  This library is deprecated: please consider using the

  vector package, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector>.'

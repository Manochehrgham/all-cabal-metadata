description: ! 'Keyboard events in web browsers are often represented as keycodes,

  which (1) are difficult to remember, and (2) sometimes vary from

  browser to browser. "Web.KeyCode" allows one to look up a key

  press''s keycode and get a plain English description of the key

  that was pressed, to reduce confusion.'

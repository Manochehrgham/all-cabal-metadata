description: ! 'Ketchup is a very small HTTP server implementation, currently 300
  LoC (for the whole thing)!


  Ketchup is also made to be as modular and embeddable as possible, if you want a
  cabal-free Haskell app, just take those two/three files you need and put it in your
  project!


  Currently Ketchup comes with:


  * Basic httpd functionality (IPV4 only for now)


  * URL Routing with parameters (ie. \/user\/:name\/)


  * Static file handler (ie. static \".\" as route/handler)


  * Basic Auth (please use it over a HTTPS reverse proxy)


  Dependencies


  The core parts of Ketchup are all depedency free, that includes Ketchup.Httpd and
  Ketchup.Utils (and to a certain extent, Ketchup.Chunked).

  The dependencies required are for the following modules:


  * Ketchup.Static (uses mime-types)


  * Ketchup.Auth (uses base64-bytestring)

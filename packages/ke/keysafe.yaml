synopsis: back up a secret key securely to the cloud
changelog: ! "keysafe (0.20160819) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * First release of
  keysafe. This is not yet ready for production use.\n  * Network support is not yet
  implemented, but --store-local works for\n    testing with local data storage.\n
  \ * Data backed up with keysafe version 0.* will not be able to be restored\n    by
  any later version! Once the data format stabalizes, keysafe version\n    1 data
  will be supported by every later version.\n  * Argon2 hashes are not yet tuned for
  modern hardware, but only for my\n    laptop. So, cracking cost estimates may be
  low. To help with this\n    tuning, run `keysafe --bechmark` and send the output
  to me.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 19 Aug 2016 19:41:06 -0400\n"

description: ! 'Keysafe backs up a secret key to several cloud servers, split up

  so that no one server can access the whole secret by itself.


  A password is used to encrypt the data, and it is made expensive

  to decrypt, so password cracking is infeasibly expensive.'

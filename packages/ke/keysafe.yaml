synopsis: back up a secret key securely to the cloud
changelog: ! "keysafe (0.20161022) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Add keywords to
  desktop file.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Fix use of .IP macro in manpage.\n
  \   Thanks, Sean Whitton\n  * Fix some mispellings.\n    Thanks, Sean Whitton\n
  \ * Makefile: Propagate LDFLAGS, CFLAGS, and CPPFLAGS through ghc.\n  * Makefile:
  Allow setting BUILDER=./Setup to build w/o cabal or stack.\n  * Makefile: Allow
  setting BUILDEROPTIONS=-j1 to avoid concurrent\n    build, which should make build
  reproducible.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 22 Oct 2016 19:01:24 -0400\n\nkeysafe
  (0.20161007) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Check if --store-local directory is
  writable.\n  * Removed dependency on crypto-random.\n  * Added a LSB init script,
  for non-systemd systems.\n    (It currently uses Debian's start-stop-daemon, so
  would need porting\n    for other distributions.)\n  * /etc/default/keysafe is read
  by both the systemd service file and the\n    init script, and contains configuration
  for the keysafe server.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 20 Oct 2016 14:44:07
  -0400\n\nkeysafe (0.20161006) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * New --add-storage-directory
  and --add-server options, which can be used\n    to make keysafe backup/restore
  using additional locations.\n  * Removed --store-local option; use --add-storage-directory
  instead.\n  * Fix bugs with entry of gpg keyid in the keysafe.log.\n  * Fix bug
  in --autostart that caused the full gpg keyid to be\n    used to generate object
  names, which made restores would only work\n    when --gpgkeyid was specifid.\n
  \ * Remove embedded copy of argon2 binding, depend on fixed version of package.\n\n

  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Makefile: Avoid rebuilding on make install, so that
  sudo make install works.\n  * Added --chaff-max-delay option for slower chaffing.\n
  \ * Fix embedded copy of Argon2 to not use Word64, fixing build on 32 bit\n    systems.\n
  \ * Randomize the server list.\n  * Don't upload more than neededshares-1 shares
  to Alternate servers\n    without asking the user if they want to do this potentially
  dangerous\n    action.\n  * Added a second keysafe server to the server list. It's
  provided\n    by Marek Isalski at Faelix. Currently located in UK, but planned move\n
  \   to CH. Currently at Alternate level until verification is complete.\n  * Server:
  --motd can be used to provide a Message Of The Day.\n  * Added --check-servers mode,
  which is useful both at the command line\n    to see what servers keysafe knows
  about, and as a cron job.\n  * Server: Round number of objects down to the nearest
  thousand, to avoid\n    leaking too much data about when objects are uploaded to
  servers.\n  * Filter out escape sequences and any other unusual characters when\n
  \   writing all messages to the console.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue,

  \ * Keysafe now knows about 3 servers, although only 1 is currently in\n    operation.
  It will queue uploads to the other 2 servers until\n    they are added in a later
  keysafe release.\n  * Added --autostart mode, and make both keysafe --backup and
  \n    the Makefile install a FDO desktop autostart file to use it.\n  * In --autostart
  mode, retry any queued uploads.\n  * In --autostart mode, check for gpg keys that
  have not been\n    backed up, and offer to back them up. Only ask once per key.\n
  \ * Changed format of ~/.keysafe/backup.log\n  * Server: Reduce number of buckets
  in rate limiter, avoiding ones with very low\n    proof of work.\n  * Server: Make
  rate limiter adapt to ongoing load more quickly -- every 15\n    minutes instead
  of every 60.\n  * Server: Added --backup-server and --restore-server to aid in backing
  \n    up keysafe servers with minimal information leakage.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>
  \ Thu, 22 Sep 2016 15:10:56 -0400\n\nkeysafe (0.20160914) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n
  \ * Fix bug that prevented keysafe --server from running when there was no\n    controlling
  terminal and zenity was not installed.\n  * Added --name and --othername options.\n
  \ * Added proof of work to client/server protocol.\n  * Server-side rate limiting
  and DOS protection.\n  * server: Added --months-to-fill-half-disk option, defaulting
  to 12.\n  * Several new dependencies.\n  * Another fix to gpg secret key list parser.\n
  \ * Warn when uploads fail and are put in the upload queue.\n  * Warn when --uploadqueued
  fails to upload to servers.\n  * Fix --uploadqueued bug that prevented deletion
  of local queued file.\n  * Added --chaff mode which uploads random junk to servers.\n
  \   This is useful both to test the server throttling of uploads,\n    and to make
  it harder for servers to know if an object actually\n    contains secret key information.\n
  \ * Store information about backed up keys in ~/.keysafe/backup.log\n    This can
  be deleted by the user at any time, but it's useful\n    in case a server is known
  to be compromised, or a problem is found\n    with keysafe's implementation that
  makes a backup insecure.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 14 Sep 2016 17:08:55
  -0400\n\nkeysafe (0.20160831) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Server implementation
  is ready for initial deployment.\n  * Keysafe as a client is not yet ready for production
  use.\n  * Removed embedded copy of secret-sharing library, since finite-field\n
  \   only supports prime fields. This caused shares to be twice the size of\n    the
  input value.\n  * Reduced chunk size to 32kb due to share size doubling.\n  * Fix
  gpg secret key list parser to support gpg 2.\n  * Tuned argon2 hash parameters on
  better hardware than my fanless laptop.\n  * Improve time estimates, taking into
  account the number of cores.\n  * Added basic test suite.\n  * Added options: --store-directory
  --test --port --address\n  * Added a Makefile\n  * Added a systemd service file.\n
  \ * Added a desktop file.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 31 Aug 2016 15:43:30
  -0400\n\nkeysafe (0.20160819) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * First release of keysafe.
  This is not yet ready for production use.\n  * Network support is not yet implemented,
  but --store-local works for\n    testing with local data storage.\n  * Data backed
  up with keysafe version 0.* will not be able to be restored\n    by any later version!
  Once the data format stabalizes, keysafe version\n    1 data will be supported by
  every later version.\n  * Argon2 hashes are not yet tuned for modern hardware, but
  only for my\n    laptop. So, cracking cost estimates may be low. To help with this\n
  \   tuning, run `keysafe --bechmark` and send the output to me.\n\n -- Joey Hess

description: ! 'Keysafe backs up a secret key to several cloud servers, split up

  so that no one server can access the whole secret by itself.


  A password is used to encrypt the data, and it is made expensive

  to decrypt, so password cracking is infeasibly expensive.'

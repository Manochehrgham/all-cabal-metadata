synopsis: back up a secret key securely to the cloud
changelog: ! "keysafe (0.20160831) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Server implementation
  is ready for initial deployment.\n  * Keysafe as a client is not yet ready for production
  use.\n  * Removed embedded copy of secret-sharing library, since finite-field\n
  \   only supports prime fields. This caused shares to be twice the size of\n    the
  input value.\n  * Reduced chunk size to 32kb due to share size doubling.\n  * Fix
  gpg secret key list parser to support gpg 2.\n  * Tuned argon2 hash parameters on
  better hardware than my fanless laptop.\n  * Improve time estimates, taking into
  account the number of cores.\n  * Added basic test suite.\n  * Added options: --store-directory
  --test --port --address\n  * Added a Makefile\n  * Added a systemd service file.\n
  \ * Added a desktop file.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 31 Aug 2016 15:43:30
  -0400\n\nkeysafe (0.20160819) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * First release of keysafe.
  This is not yet ready for production use.\n  * Network support is not yet implemented,
  but --store-local works for\n    testing with local data storage.\n  * Data backed
  up with keysafe version 0.* will not be able to be restored\n    by any later version!
  Once the data format stabalizes, keysafe version\n    1 data will be supported by
  every later version.\n  * Argon2 hashes are not yet tuned for modern hardware, but
  only for my\n    laptop. So, cracking cost estimates may be low. To help with this\n
  \   tuning, run `keysafe --bechmark` and send the output to me.\n\n -- Joey Hess

description: ! 'Keysafe backs up a secret key to several cloud servers, split up

  so that no one server can access the whole secret by itself.


  A password is used to encrypt the data, and it is made expensive

  to decrypt, so password cracking is infeasibly expensive.'

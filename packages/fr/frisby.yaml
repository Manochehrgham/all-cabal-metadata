description: ! 'frisby is a parser library that can parse arbitrary PEG

  grammars in linear time. Unlike other parsers of PEG grammars,

  frisby need not be supplied with all possible rules up front,

  allowing composition of smaller parsers.


  PEG parsers are never ambiguous and allow infinite lookahead

  with no backtracking penalty. Since PEG parsers can look ahead

  arbitrarily, they can easily express rules such as the maximal

  munch rule used in lexers, meaning no separate lexer is needed.


  In addition to many standard combinators, frisby provides

  routines to translate standard regex syntax into frisby parsers.'

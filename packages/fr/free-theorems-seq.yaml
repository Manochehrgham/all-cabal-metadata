description: ! 'Given a term, this program calculates a set of \"optimal\" free theorems

  that hold in a lambda calculus with selective strictness. It omits

  totality (in general, bottom-reflection) and other restrictions when

  possible. The underlying theory is described in the paper \"Taming

  Selective Strictness\" (ATPS''09) by Daniel Seidel and Janis Voigtl√§nder.

  A webinterface for the program is running online at

  <http://www-ps.iai.uni-bonn.de/cgi-bin/polyseq.cgi>

  or available offline via the package

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/free-theorems-seq-webui>.


  Related to this package you may be interested in the online free theorem generator

  at <http://www-ps.iai.uni-bonn.de/ft> that is also available offline via

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/free-theorems-webui>.

  Additionally interesting may be the counterexample generator for free theorems that

  exemplifies the need of strictness conditions imposed by general recursion.

  It can be downloaded at

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/free-theorems-counterexamples>

  or used via a webinterface at

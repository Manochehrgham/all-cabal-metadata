description: ! 'The free-theorems library allows to automatically generate free

  theorems from Haskell type expressions. It supports nearly all

  Haskell 98 types except of type constructor classes, and in

  addition it can also handle higher-rank functions. Free theorems

  are generated for three different sublanguages of Haskell, a

  basic one corresponding to the polymorphic lambda-calculus of

  Girard-Reynolds, an extension of that allowing for recursion and

  errors, and finally a sublanguage additionally allowing seq.

  In the last two sublanguages, also inequational free theorems

  may be derived in addition to classical equational results.'

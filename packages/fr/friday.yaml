description: ! 'Friday provides functions to manipulate images in a

  functional way.

  The library is designed to be fast, generic and

  type-safe.


  Images can be represented in two representations:


  * the ''Manifest'' representation stores images in Haskell

  ''Vector''s ;


  * the ''Delayed'' representation uses functions to produce

  images pixels. These images can be combined to produce

  complex transformations. By some inlining, Haskell

  compilers are able to produce fast algorithms by

  removing intermediate structures.


  The library currently support four color spaces: RGB,

  RGBA, HSV and gray-scale images.


  Please read our

  <https://github.com/RaphaelJ/friday/blob/master/README.md README>

  to get a detailed usage and some examples.'

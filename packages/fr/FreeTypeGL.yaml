description: ! 'Based on the freetype-gl library, with large

  modifications.


  This is similar to the FTGL (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/FTGL>)

  library, but avoids C++, which makes it easier to wrap and work with

  in Haskell-land.


  Unfortunately, it seems not to perform as well as

  FTGL on some setups.


  NOTE: Most of the demos and C-side documentation

  are out-of-date, as the C side was heavily

  modified, without updating many of the demos or

  the C documentation.'

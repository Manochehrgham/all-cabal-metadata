description: ! 'Package @rtld@ provides simplistic interface to the dynamic linker/loader.

  It wraps ''dlopen/dlclose'' family of functions (''LoadLibrary/FreeLibrary''

  on Windows) and tries to provide a common interface to dynamically load

  foreign libraries at runtime. It is used currently as a helper package

  for @curlhs@ (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/curlhs>), but is not

  ready for the public use (more tests and design decisions needed).


  Package is distributed under ISC License (MIT/BSD-style, see LICENSE file

  for details). It is marked as @OtherLicense@ due to limitations of Cabal.

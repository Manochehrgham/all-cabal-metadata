  -----------


  This package provides a simple interface to the `aspell` spell checker

  tool. In particular, this library communicates with `aspell` using

  its pipe interface rather than linking directly to the Aspell shared

  library. This is because in some cases it is desirable to avoid a shared

  library dependency and to deal gracefully with an absent spell checker.


  To get started, see the Haddock documentation for `Text.Aspell`.

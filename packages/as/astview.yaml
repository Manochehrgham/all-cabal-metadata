description: ! 'Astview is a graphical viewer for abstract

  syntax trees. It is implemented on the basis

  of scrap-your-boilerplate (i.e. data2tree)

  and works with all parsers that generate trees

  that are instances of the Data.Data class.

  Custom parsers can be dynamically loaded

  (via package hint) at startup.


  For installation you need gtk2hs and hscolour before.

  The latter will not be automatically installed by

  cabal since it is used by Setup.hs.'

  This library provides FFI bindings to the Assimp asset import

  library. It requires Assimp to already be installed. For more

  information about Assimp see the assimp website at

  <http://assimp.sourceforge.net/>.


  This release corresponds to Assimp 2.0. When this package stabilizes I

  intend to track new releases of Assimp by also releasing new versions with

  the same version number, but this should be considered a beta release.

  Importing models is currently working. Textures and animations are

  untested.


  Here is a sample program that imports a scene and then outputs the

  information contained in it.


  > module Main where

  >

  > import System (getArgs)

  > import Graphics.Formats.Assimp

  >

  > -- Defines the preprocessing we want assimp to perform

  > processing = [ CalcTangentSpace

  >              , Triangulate

  >              , JoinIdenticalVertices

  >              , SortByPType

  >              ]

  >

  > main = do

  >   args <- getArgs

  >   scene <- importFile (head args) processing

  >   print scene                   -- Outputs all information in the scene

  >   getVersionMajor >>= print     -- Print the major version of assimp

  >   getVersionMinor >>= print     -- Print the minor version of assimp

  >   getVersionRevision >>= print  -- Print the version revision of assimp

description: ! 'FpML, the Financial Products Markup Language, is the business

  exchange standard for electronic dealing and processing of

  financial derivatives instruments.  It establishes a protocol

  for sharing information on, and dealing in, swaps, derivatives,

  and structured products.  It is based on XML, the standard

  meta-language for describing data shared between applications.

  All categories of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives will

  eventually be incorporated into the standard.

  This package is an automatically-generated binding to version 5.3 of

  the FpML standard.  The object-oriented typing discipline of the

  original XSD definition of FpML has been translated into Haskell''s

  algebraic types.  Type classes for parsing from, and outputting to,

  XML documents are instantiated for all types.'

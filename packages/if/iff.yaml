description: ! 'The Interchange File Format of Electronic Arts is a container format
  used for many kinds of data.

  Common file formats are

  e.g. IFF-8SVX for 8-bit sampled sounds and

  IFF-ILBM for images in an interleaved way that is close to image representation
  in Amiga computers.

  Cf. <http://netghost.narod.ru/gff/vendspec/iff/index.htm>

  This library does only handle the IFF container format

  and does not handle any specific IFF data type.

  The intention is the same as of Amiga''s @iffparse.library@.

  See <http://wiki.amigaos.net/index.php/IFFParse_Library>.'

description: ! 'turing-music interprets 42 built-in Turing machines with 5 states
  and 2 symbols.

  In every 0.1 second, a motion is done and the contents of the tape is printed.

  At the same time, a sound is played. The pitch of the sound depends on the position
  of the last change

  on the tape.


  The built-in machines are busy beaver candidates.

  A busy beaver is a Turing machine which, when given an empty tape, does a lot of
  work, then halts.

  Currently it is not known whether these simple machines halt or not.'

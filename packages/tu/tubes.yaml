description: ! 'This package provides the @Tube@ monad transformer, allowing any monad

  computation to become a stream processing pipeline. A computation of type

  @Tube a b m r@ consumes values of type ''a'' and produces values of type

  ''b''.


  @Tube@s are coroutines which can suspend computation to yield an

  intermediate value or continue execution by requesting an upstream value.

  If I managed to upload another faulty package that does not build

  correctly, Hackage documentation is also available at

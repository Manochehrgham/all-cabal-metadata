description: ! 'This package provides the @Tube@ monad transformer, allowing any monad

  computation to become a stream processing pipeline. A computation of type

  @Tube a b m r@ consumes values of type ''a'' and produces values of type

  ''b''.


  @Tube@s are coroutines which can suspend computation to yield an

  intermediate value or continue execution by requesting an upstream value.


  Also provided are @Pump@s, the comonadic dual to @Tube@s. Examples are

  provided of how they can be used with @Tube@s but we have almost certainly

  only scratched the surface.


  Examples and more information may be found at

  <https://github.com/gatlin/tubes>.


  I seem to have trouble uploading packages where the documentation can be

  built correctly on Hackage. If I have (once again) messed this up, you can

  find Haddock documentation at <https://niltag.net/tubes>. I apologize for

  any inconvenience!


  This should compile on GHC 7.8, but the problem

  is that previous attempts at setting the versions properly rendered Hackage

  unable to generate documentation. Hopefully I have this fixed but any

  advice is welcome.'

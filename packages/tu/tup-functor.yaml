description: ! 'Homogeneous tuples (also known as vectors), with various instances,
  most notably ''Functor'' and ''Applicative''.

  The primary goal of the library is to help functor-oriented programming

  (for low-dimensional linear algebra, there are more specific packages, eg. @vect@).

  A small preprocessor for a tuple syntax is also included. We provide 4 different
  implementations,

  with a unified type class interface.'

description: ! 'This package provides some stock lenses for swizzling tuple elements.
  For instance:


  >> (1,2,3)^._13

  > (1, 3)


  The package provide all lenses that are in increasing order, for FieldN classes
  1-9. If you

  want to swap the order or permute the elements, you need to make your own.


  Custom combos are provided by a Template Haskell function.


  >> (''a'',''b'',''c'',''d'') ^. $(tl [4,1,2,3])

  > (''d'',''a'',''b'',''c'')'

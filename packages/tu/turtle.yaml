description: ! '@turtle@ is a reimplementation of the Unix command line environment

  in Haskell so that you can use Haskell as both a shell and a scripting

  language.


  Features include:


  * Batteries included: Command an extended suite of predefined utilities


  * Interoperability: You can still run external shell commands


  * Portability: Works on Windows, OS X, and Linux


  * Exception safety: Safely acquire and release resources


  * Streaming: Transform or fold command output in constant space


  * Patterns: Use typed regular expressions that can parse structured values


  * Formatting: Type-safe @printf@-style text formatting


  * Modern: Supports @text@ and @system-filepath@


  Read "Turtle.Tutorial" for a detailed tutorial or "Turtle.Prelude" for a

  quick-start guide


  @turtle@ is designed to be beginner-friendly, but as a result lacks certain

  features, like tracing commands.  If you feel comfortable using @turtle@

  then you should also check out the @Shelly@ library which provides similar

  functionality.'

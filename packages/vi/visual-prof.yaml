description: ! 'visual-prof profiles your Haskell program and generates a html file
  containing

  its source code with parts of the code highlighted in different

  colors depending on the fraction of the running time that they take.

  visual-prof gives you an easy way to find places for optimization in your code.


  Usage:


  > visual-prof -px A/B/C.hs run "arg1 arg2"


  This will profile the C.hs file used by run.hs which contains the Main module

  of your project. Arguments to ./run are passed as shown (arg1, arg2,...). The parameters

  should be given in that order.


  The simplest way to run it is:


  > visual-prof -px test.hs test


  which will generate a profile for the file test.hs (which needs to have a main function)'

  ---------


  Added utilities for working with the `FieldRec` type.


  Vinyl 0.5

  =========


  Vinyl 0.5 combines the generality of Vinyl 0.4 with the ease-of-use of previous

  versions by eschewing the defunctionalized type families and just using plain

  type constructors; Vinyl 0.4-style records can be recovered in most cases in a

  modular manner without baking it into the fabric of Vinyl itself.


  Also new in 0.5 is a unified lens-based approach to subtyping, coercion and

  projection.


  Vinyl 0.4

  =========


  Vinyl 0.4 is a big departure from previous versions, in that it introduces a

  universe encoding as a means to generalize the space of keys from strings to

  any arbitrary space. This means that you can have closed universes for your

  records.

  Jon''s talk at BayHac 2014, [Programming in

  Vinyl](http://www.jonmsterling.com/posts/2014-05-19-programming-in-vinyl-bayhac.html).

description: ! 'An interpreter for what is essentially Microsoft BASIC v2,

  what you might find on a computer in the late 70s or early

  80s, such as the Commodore 64.


  Rather than making use of traditional stack-based primitives,

  the implementation uses monad transformers, including one

  with resumable exceptions that can caught by a program''s

  continuation rather than its context.'

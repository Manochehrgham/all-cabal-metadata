description: ! 'Vigilance is a dead man''s switch (See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch>)

  (or vigilance switch). You define named @watches that you expect to happen

  and how long to wait inbetween before it''s time to worry. You then instrument

  your periodical tasks, whatever they are, to report to vigilance via a simple

  HTTP POST or with the included client. You can then

  configure notifications that will fire when a watch fails

  to check in.

  View the README on the homepage for more details.

  Install notes:

  On client installs where you may not want to install the

  server component, configure like:


  > cabal configure -fno-server


  On client installs where you may not want to install the

  client component, configure like:


  > cabal configure -fno-client

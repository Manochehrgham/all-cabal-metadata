  ## Getting started


  To get started with the library, clone the repo and then install Haskell Stack.


  Next, build the project:


  ```

  $ stack build


  ```

  Documentation can be generated by running the next command:


  ```

  $ stack haddock


  ```


  Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:


  ```

  $ stack test

  ```

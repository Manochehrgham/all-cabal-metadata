description: ! 'At the moment, this module only provides minimal

  functionality, just enough to support the

  "distributed-process-azure" package (Azure backend for

  Cloud Haskell). However, the code is set up in such a way

  that adding additional functionality should be relatively

  straightforward; developers who wish to do will probably

  want to consult the Windows Azure Service Management REST

  API Reference

  (<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460799.aspx>).'

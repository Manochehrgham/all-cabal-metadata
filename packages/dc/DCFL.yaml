description: An implementation of Communication Free Learning, a technique used to
  solve Constraint Satisfcation Problems (CSPs) in a parallelizable manner. The algorithm
  is described in the paper Decentralized Constraint Satisfaction by Duffy, et. al.
  and this implementation provides both parallel and serial solvers.

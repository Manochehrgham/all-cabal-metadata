description: ! 'A package that provides dynamic labels in the form of conjunctions
  of disjunctions of principals. This package is intended to only be used at the computer
  science school ECI 2011 (Buenos Aires, Argentina) <http://www.dc.uba.ar/events/eci/2011/index_html>.
  Please, refer to the official release of dclabels if you plan to use it for other
  purposes.

  The /DC Label/ (DCLabel) library provides dynamic information

  flow control label format in the form of conjunctions of

  disjunctions of principals. Most code should import module

  "DCLabel.Safe"; trusted code should import "DCLabel.TCB".

  The core functionality of the library is documented in

  "DCLabel.Core", while the small EDSL used to create labels is

  documented in "DCLabel.NanoEDSL". DCLabel was implemented by David

  Mazieres (<http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/>), Deian Stefan

  (<http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/>), and Alejandro Russo

  (<http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~russo/>).

  To obtain the latest experimental source code, run:

  @git clone http:\/\/www.scs.stanford.edu\/~deian\/dclabel.git@'

description: ! 'This software is intended to help a developer designing electronic

  circuits by describing them with arrows. The arrow notation represents

  the according. From the netlist the developer can generate various

  other formats by "compiling" the arrow into them. With this software

  three basic compilers are shipped. One generates a simple textual

  representation that helps debugging the actual circuit. Another

  generates VHDL representations of the circuit. The third one generates

  DOT syntax for visualization of circuits.'

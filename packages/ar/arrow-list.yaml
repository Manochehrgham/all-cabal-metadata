description: ! 'This small Haskell library provides some type class, types and functions
  to

  work with list (and list-like) arrows. List arrows represent computations

  that may return multiple outputs. Making functions that return lists an

  instance of both the `Category` and `Arrow` type class allow you to easily

  compose multiple computations into one with standard building blocks.'

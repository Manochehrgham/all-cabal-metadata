description: ! 'The @ARX@ system provides services for packaging, deploying and running

  source code. No particular format or framework is needed -- a directory of

  code and a command to run are enough. The system has no in-built notion of

  remote connections, job servers or clusters; all automation is captured as

  Bourne compatible scripts.


  An archive of the source code, a command and optionally an environment are

  encoded together in a Bourne shell script that uses a small number of UNIX

  utilities in a broadly portable way. The generated scripts can be run

  directly or fed to @sh@ on STDIN. This latter feature is useful when one

  would like to use @ssh@ and @sudo@ to set an appropriate executation

  context, for example running: @ssh user\@example.com sudo sh@.


  The shell tools used are @head@, @sed@, @date@, @tr@ and @tar@. The calls to

  @tar@ sometimes use @-j@ and @-z@; these calls to @tar@ may result in calls

  to @bzip2@ and @gzip@. Scripts have been tested with @dash@ and the GNU

  tools as well as the @sh@ and tools that are part of @busybox@.


  The @arx@ command line tool provides the @tmpx@ subcommand for preparing

  jobs to run and the @shdat@ subcommand for access to the low-level shell

  encoder. The @System.Posix.ARX@ module provides access to the routines used

  for constructing commands and environments, describing archives and building

  Bourne shell scripts.


  One way I have used @arx@ is to test the Cabal source archive for this

  package:


  @

  arx tmpx .\/dist\/arx-* \/\/ ''cd arx-* && cabal configure && cabal build'' | sh

  @


  There are binary @arx@ command line tool releases available from:


  <https://github.com/solidsnack/arx/downloads>


  For each supported platform, there is an archive containing @arx@ and

  signature files (SHA 512 and GPG).'

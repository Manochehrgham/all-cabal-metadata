description: ! 'A preprocessor that reads Haskell with arrow notation

  and outputs Haskell 98.  Note that GHC 6.2 or later has

  built-in support for arrow notation, so if you''re only

  using GHC, you don''t need this preprocessor: just rename

  your arrow module as an ordinary Haskell source file and

  add a @LANGUAGE Arrows@ pragma at the top.  GHC also

  gives better error messages for arrow code.'

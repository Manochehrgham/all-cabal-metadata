description: ! 'Argon performs static analysis on your code in order to compute cyclomatic

  complexity. It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly

  indipendent paths through the code.


  The intended usage is through Argon''s executable, which accepts a list of

  file paths to analyze. The data can be optionally exported to JSON.'

synopsis: ! 'Efficient basic number-theoretic functions.

  Primes, powers, integer logarithms.'
changelog: ! "0.4.1.0:\n    Add integerLog10 variants at Bas van Dijk's request and
  expose\n    Math.NumberTheory.Powers.Integer, with an added integerWordPower.\n0.4.0.4:\n
  \   Update for GHC-7.8, the type of some primops changed, they return Int# now\n
  \   instead of Bool.\n    Fixed bugs in modular square roots and factorisation.\n0.4.0.3:\n
  \   Relaxed dependencies on mtl and containers\n    Fixed warnings from GHC-7.5,
  Word(..) moved to GHC.Types\n    Removed SPECIALISE pragma from inline function
  (warning from 7.5, probably\n    pointless anyway)\n0.4.0.2:\n    Sped up factor
  sieves. They need more space now, but the speedup is worth it, IMO.\n    Raised
  spec-constr limit in MoebiusInversion.Int\n0.4.0.1:\n    Fixed Haddock bug\n0.4.0.0:\n
  \   Added generalised Moebius inversion, to be continued\n0.3.0.0:\n    Added modular
  square roots and Chinese remainder theorem\n0.2.0.6:\n    Performance tweaks for
  powerModInteger (~10%) and\n    invertMod (~25%).\n0.2.0.5:\n    Fix bug in psieveFrom\n0.2.0.4:\n
  \   Fix bug in nthPrime\n0.2.0.3:\n    Fix bug in powerMod\n0.2.0.2:\n    Relax
  bounds on array dependency for 7.4.*\n0.2.0.1:\n    Fix copy-pasto (only relevant
  for 7.3.*)\n    Fix imports for ghc >= 7.3\n0.2.0.0:\n    Added certificates and
  certified testing/factorisation\n0.1.0.2:\n    Fixed doc bugs\n0.1.0.1:\n    Elaborate
  on overflow, work more on native Ints in Eratosthenes\n0.1.0.0:\n    First release\n"

description: ! 'A library of basic functionality needed for

  number-theoretic calculations. The aim of this library

  is to provide efficient implementations of the functions.

  Primes and related things (totients, factorisation),

  powers (integer roots and tests, modular exponentiation),

  integer logarithms.

  Note: Requires GHC >= 6.12 with the integer-gmp package

  for efficiency. Portability is on the to-do list (with

  low priority, however).'

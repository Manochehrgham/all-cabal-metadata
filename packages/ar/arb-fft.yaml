description: ! 'This library provides a pure Haskell complex-to-complex Fast Fourier

  Transform implementation for arbitrary length input vectors, using a

  mixed-radix decimation-in-time algorithm with specialised

  straight-line code for a range of base transform sizes, Rader''s

  algorithm for prime length base transforms, and an empirical

  optimisation scheme to select a good problem decomposition.


  This package is probably primarily of pedagogical interest (FFTW is

  about five times faster for most input sizes).  There is a long

  series of blog articles describing the development of the package,

  indexed at <http://www.skybluetrades.net/haskell-fft-index.html>.'

synopsis: Haskell bindings to libargon2 - the reference implementation of the Argon2
  password-hashing function
changelog: ! "# 1.2.0\n\n- Updated embedded phc-winner-argon2, so that hashes are
  generated\n  using version 1.3 of the argon2 specification.\n  \n  Note that that
  hashes generated using this version are different than\n  hashes generated using
  previous versions, so anything that compares them\n  or relies on them being stable
  may be broken by this update. \n  However, Crypto.Argon2.verify will continue to
  be able to verify\n  hashes produced by previous versions.\n\n- Use CSize for portability
  instead of Word64, fixing build on 32 bit\n  systems. This changed the constructors
  of Argon2Exception, an API change.\n\n- Bug fix: Crypto.Argon2.hash returned a ByteString
  truncated at the first\n  NULL.\n\n- Added use-system-library build flag.\n\n- Build
  against `base-4.9`\n\n# 1.1.0\n\n- First stable release. Same API as 1.0.0, but
  now features documentation and\n  expected type class instances for data types.\n\n-
  QuickCheck properties added:\n\n  1. verify (hashEncoded options password salt)
  password == True\n  2. hash options password salt /= password\n\n- `hash` now uses
  the underlying \"raw\" hash routines, rather than the encoded\n  routines. This
  was a bug in 1.0.0. Thanks to @jorgen for this fix.\n\n- `verify` added, in order
  to correctly verify that a password matches an \n  encoded password.\n\n- `defaultHashOptions`
  are now more expensive.\n\n# 1.0.0\n\n- Initial release\n"

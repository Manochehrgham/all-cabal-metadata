description: ! "# tce-conf\n\n\n## Synopsis\n\nVery simple config file reading (Haskell)\n\n\n##
  Description\n\nThis package contains modules for runtime reading of very simple\nconfig
  files of the `key=value` style or as a Haskell data structure\nto be deserialized
  with `Read`. The modules support files with\nblank lines and simple single-line
  comments, but nothing else.\n\n### KVConf\n\nPros\n\n- Well-known `key=value` config
  file syntax\n- Adding new entries doesn't necessarily mean code changes as they\n
  \ are stored in a Map\n\nCons\n\n- All values are `String` and so may as well be
  untyped. Conversion\n  to other types will be required by users of the library.\n-
  Simulating hierarchies requires hacky key syntax with dots or\n  what-have-you\n-
  Only single-line comments supported at this time, with #\n- No support for INI sections
  or variable substitution\n\n\n### ReadConf\n\nPros\n\n- Config files are strongly
  typed Haskell source code. `Read`\n  instancing takes care of everything!\n- Can
  easily support hierarchical data because Haskell data types\n  do so\n\nCons\n\n-
  Config files must adhere to Haskell source syntax (may not be a\n  con for some)\n-
  Changing the config file at all requires code changes to keep\n  the types synced
  with each other.\n- Only single-line comments supported at this time, with --\n-
  No support for variable substitution\n\n\n## Getting source\n\n- Get the source
  with darcs: `$ darcs get http://hub.darcs.net/dino/tce-conf`\n- If you're just looking,
  [browse the source](http://hub.darcs.net/dino/tce-conf)\n\nAnd once you have it,
  building the usual way:\n\n    $ stack build\n    $ stack test\n\n\n## Contact\n\nDino

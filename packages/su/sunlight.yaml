description: ! 'sunlight checks your Cabalized package and ensures that it actually

  builds and passes its tests, even against mulitple dependency

  versions specified in your Cabal file.  For example, your Cabal file

  might say that your package builds against base-4.5.1.0

  and base-4.6.0.1.  With

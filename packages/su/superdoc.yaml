description: ! 'This package extends Cabal''s documentation building capabilities.

  It extends the Haddock markup language with syntax for subscripts,

  superscripts, bold text, non-breaking spaces, and images. Moreover,

  it works around various bugs in Haddock''s and HsColour''s Unicode

  support, making it possible to use UTF8 encodings in both source

  code and documentation comments.


  This package is designed to work transparently. It provides a custom

  main function that package maintainers can use in their Setup.hs

  file. In most cases, this is as simple as setting the build-type to

  Custom, adding superdoc to the package dependencies, and putting the

  following two lines into Setup.hs:


  > import Distribution.Superdoc

  > main = superdocMain


  For more information on the available markup, see "Distribution.Superdoc".'

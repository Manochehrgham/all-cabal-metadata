description: ! 'Two small example programs where SuperCollider is controlled by MIDI.


  * Control parameters of a wind noise via MIDI controllers


  * Use UGens as instruments,

  which will be played upon MIDI messages that arrive through ALSA.

  This way you can play MIDI files using @pmidi@

  or you can use your computer as MIDI expander controlled by a keyboard.'

description: ! 'This pacakge provides the

  ''Control.Applicative.Successors.Succs'' functor. It models

  a node in a graph together with its successors. The

  @Applicative@ (and @Monad@) instances are designed so that

  the successors of the resulting value take exactly one

  step, either in the left or the right argument to @<*>@

  (or @>>=@).'

changelog: ! "2016-06-03  Moses D. Liskov <mliskov@mitre.org>\n\n\t* doc/examples/IKE_variants.tar.gz:
  Added this compressed archive\n\tof IKEv1 and IKEv2 variant input files.\n\t\n2016-03-30
  \ John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/SAS/SAS.hs: Added support
  for fringe skeletons so that\n\tcpassas makes use of depth limited output.  When
  a tree depth\n\tlimit is exceeded, a fringe labeled skeleton is printed.  cpsasas\n\tproduces
  a sentence with a right-hand-side that encodes both the\n\tshapes and the fringe.
  \ Thus, when cpsa is running the a tree\n\tdepth limit of one, cpsasas computes
  a cohort analysis sentence.\n\n2016-03-29  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  src/CPSA/Lib/Reduction.hs (LPreskel): Added a depth field, so\n\tthat CPSA aborts
  when the depth of one branch exceeds a bound.\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs: Added
  escapeSet to Term class and remove\n\tprotectors, thus computing the escape set
  in a more\n\tstraightforward way.\n\n2015-11-23  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  src/CPSA/SAS/Main.hs (main): Changed start up so that the herald\n\tis read and
  used to find the correct algebra for further\n\tprocessing.\n\n2015-10-02  John
  D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* doc/{index,cpsauser}.html: Added width
  limit of 48em.\n\n2015-07-09  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Graph/ExpandedView.hs
  (purgeTraces): By default, the\n\tgraph program now does not show traces in skeletons.
  \ Added\n\t--show-traces option to the graph program, which restores the\n\tprevious
  behavior and traces are displayed in skeletons.\n\n2015-07-02  John D. Ramsdell
  \ <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Algebra.hs: Added constituent to the
  algebra\n\tinterface and the algebras.  An atom is a constituent of a term if\n\tthe
  atom is among the set of atoms required to construct the term.\n\tChanged occursIn
  so that it just applies to variables.\n\n2015-07-01  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  src/CPSA/{Basic,DiffieHellman}/Algebra.hs (occursIn): Restricted\n\tfirst argument
  of occursIn to variables and atoms and corrected\n\tthe implementation.\n\n2015-06-30
  \ John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n \t* cpsa3.cabal (Version): Tagged as
  3.2.2.\n\n2015-06-25  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs
  (geq): Removed dynamic role specific test\n\tbecause it erroneously reports violations.
  \ The existing static\n\trole specific test correctly does the job.\n\n2015-05-26
  \ John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n \t* cpsa3.cabal (Version): Tagged as
  3.2.1.\n\n\t* src/CPSA/DiffieHellman/Algebra.hs (displayTerm):  Made it so\n\tthat
  CPSA prints each bltk atoms in a canonical form so that the\n\tgraph program draws
  solid arrows when it should.\n\n2015-04-27  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  src/CPSA/Lib/Loader.hs (ReturnFail): Added ReturnFail Monad so\n\tthat fail is correctly
  handled.  Added Functor and Applicative\n\tinstance to support GHC 7.10 base library.\n\n2015-04-20
  \ John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Characteristic.hs (mkDcls):
  Fixed tag for non-orig\n\tand pen-non-orig.\n\n2015-04-10  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (mkListener): The role used for listener\n\tstrands is now
  the one stored in the protocol.  It has a single\n\tvariable x of sort mesg as its
  set of variables.  This change\n\tenables satisfaction checking on skeleton that
  include listeners.\n\n2015-04-07  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (toSkeleton): Removed hulling to the\n\tprocess of converting
  an input preskeleton into a skeleton as it\n\tcauses bugs in printing.\n\n\t* Imported
  CPSA2's implementation of goals and expunged support\n\tfor subgoals.\n\n2015-03-27
  \ John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (toSkeleton):
  Added hulling to the\n\tprocess of converting an input preskeleton into a skeleton.\n\n2015-03-25
  \ John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Goal.hs: Added uniq
  to goal language.\n\n2015-03-17  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/SAS/SAS.hs
  (form): Generate a defsas form rather than a\n\tnaked sentence.\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Loader.hs
  (loadPrimary): Renamed equals function\n\tsymbol to =.\n\n2015-03-05  John D. Ramsdell
  \ <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n \t* cpsa3.cabal (Version): Tagged as 3.2.0.\n\n2015-02-20
  \ John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* Added support for subgoals within
  point-of-view skeletons.  The\n\tsubgoals are evaluated for each shape, and (satisfies-a-subgoal)\n\tis
  added to a shape when it satisfies one of the subgoals.\n\n2014-12-11  John D. Ramsdell
  \ <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Entry.hs (defaultOptions): Changed the
  default\n\tstrand bound to 12.\n\n2014-11-15  John D.  Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  src/CPSA/SAS/SAS.hs: Changed the language used for a shape\n\tanalysis sentence
  to be node-oriented.\n\n2014-11-07  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  src/CPSA/Lib/Loader.hs (loadPriorities): Allowed priority\n\tdeclarations on state
  synchronization nodes other than\n\tinitiatizers.\n\n2014-11-07  John D. Ramsdell
  \ <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Cohort.hs (explainable): Added the nodes
  reachable\n\tby strand succession so that a transition can be explained by a\n\tprevious
  transition within a strand.\n\n2014-10-31  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  \ Changed the name of the logic producing program to cpsa3sas.\n\n2014-09-01  John
  D.  Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/Strand.hs (noStateSplit):
  An observer node should have\n\tat most one transition node after it too.\n\n2014-08-31
  \ John D.  Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t* src/CPSA/Lib/State.hs: Made labels
  optional.  Use \"tran\" for\n\tstate synchronization events with labels, and \"sync\"
  for ones\n\twithout.\n\n2014-08-29  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*
  src/CPSA/Lib/*.hs: Added support for analyzing protocols with\n\tstate.  A state
  synchronization event sync was added to the events\n\tthat can occur in a trace,
  along with a new method for state-based\n\taugmentation.  An example using sync
  events is in\n\ttst/envelope.scm.\n\n2014-08-26  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>\n\n\t*

description: ! 'CPSA: Cryptographic Protocol Shapes Analyzer


  This program has been built and tested using Haskell Platform.

  It is available from <http://haskell.org> or from an operating

  system specific source.  The name of the Linux package is usually

  haskell-platform.


  If the Internet is available, install CPSA with:


  $ cabal update

  $ cabal install cpsa


  Find the documentation directory by typing "cpsa -h" in a command

  shell, and view index.html in a browser.


  INSTALLING FROM A TARBALL


  QUICK START (Linux)


  : To build and install CPSA type:

  $ make

  $ make install


  : To analyze a protocol you have put in prob.scm type:

  $ cpsa -o prob.txt prob.scm

  $ cpsagraph -o prob.xhtml prob.txt

  $ firefox -remote "openFile(`pwd`/prob.xhtml)"


  : Documentation and samples are in the directory given by

  $ cpsa -h


  : To view the user guide:

  $ firefox -remote "openFile($HOME/share/cpsa-X.Y.Z/doc/cpsauser.html)"

  : where X.Y.Z is the CPSA version number.


  QUICK START (Mac)


  : To build and install CPSA type:

  $ make

  $ make install


  : To analyze a protocol you have put in prob.scm type:

  $ cpsa -o prob.txt prob.scm

  $ cpsagraph -o prob.xhtml prob.txt

  $ open prob.xhtml


  : Documentation and samples are in the directory given by

  $ cpsa -h


  : To view the user guide:

  $ open $HOME/share/cpsa-X.Y.Z/doc/cpsauser.html

  : where X.Y.Z is the CPSA version number.


  QUICK START (Windows)


  The software has been tested on a Windows system on which neither

  MinGW or Cygwin has been installed.  Install GHC and then run the

  "setup.bat" batch file with administrator privileges.


  If you do not have administrator privileges, run:


  C:\...> runghc Setup.hs configure --user

  C:\...> runghc Setup.hs build


  The executables will be found in the dist\build subdirectories.


  Documentation and samples are in the directory given by

  C:\...> cpsa -h


  The installed programs can be run from the command prompt or via a

  batch file.  Alternatively, copy doc/Make.hs into the directory

  containing your CPSA problem statements, and load it into a Haskell

  interpreter.  Read the source for usage instructions.


  MAKEFILE


  The file $HOME/share/cpsa-X.Y.Z/doc/cpsa.mk contains useful GNU Make

  rules for inclusion, where X.Y.Z is CPSA version number.


  Alternatively, copy the file Make.hs in the same directory into the

  directory containing your CPSA problem statements.  The source file

  has usage instructions.


  PARALLELISM


  CPSA is built so it can make use of multiple processors.  To make use

  of more than one processor, start CPSA with a runtime flag that

  specifies the number of processors to be used, such as "+RTS -N4

  -RTS".  The GHC documentation describes the -N option in detail.


  DOCUMENTATION


  The starting point for CPSA documentation doc/index.html.  Most users

  should read it and skip the rest of this section.


  To build the documentation, the file supp-pdf.tex must be installed.

  It is part of the TexLive texmf ConTeXt package.  On Linux, the name

  of the package is context or texlive-context.  The design document and

  the specification document require the xy-pic package, which is

  included in texlive-pictures.


  The documentation includes a user guide as an XHTML document, and

  three LaTeX documents.  The CPSA Primer provides the background

  required to make effective use of the CPSA tool collection.  For those

  interested in the implementation, The CPSA Theory contains a

  high-level description of the algorithm and the current state of the

  effort to show that when program terminates, it produces a description

  of every possible execution of the protocol consistent with the

  initial point-of-view skeleton.  The CPSA Specification formally

  describes the implemented algorithm as a term reduction system.  The

  CPSA Design describes implementation details and assumes The CPSA

  Specification has been read.  The CPSA Design should be read if one is

  interested in reading the Haskell source for the tool collection.


  TEST SUITE


  : To run the test suite type:

  $ ./cpsatst


  Tests with the .scm extension are expected to complete without error,

  tests with the .lsp extension are expected to fail, and tests with the

  .lisp extension are not run.  New users should read tst/README, and

  then browse the files it suggests while reading CPSA documentation.


  Don''t develop your protocols in the tst directory.  The Makefile is

  optimized for testing the cpsa program, not analyzing protocols.


  ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS


  The src directory of the source distributions includes programs

  written in Scheme, Prolog, and Elisp for performing tasks.  Use them

  as templates for your special purpose CPSA analysis and transformation

  needs.  Also, when given the --json option, the CPSA pretty printer

  cpsapp will transform CPSA S-expressions into JavaScript Object

  Notation (JSON).


  On Linux, the GHC runtime can request so much memory that thrashing

  results.  The script in src/ghcmemlimit sets an environment variable

  that limits memory to the amount of free and reclaimable memory on

  your machine.


  KNOWN BUGS


  Variable separation in generalization fails to separate variables in

  terms of the form (ltk a a).

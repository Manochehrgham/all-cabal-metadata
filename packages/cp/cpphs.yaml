description: ! 'Cpphs is a re-implementation of the C pre-processor that is both

  more compatible with Haskell, and itself written in Haskell so

  that it can be distributed with compilers.


  This version of the C pre-processor is pretty-much

  feature-complete and compatible with traditional (K&R)

  pre-processors.  Additional features include: a plain-text mode;

  an option to unlit literate code files; and an option to turn

  off macro-expansion.'

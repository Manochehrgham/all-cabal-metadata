description: ! 'Fast AES cipher implementation with advanced mode of operations.


  The modes of operations available are ECB (Electronic code book),

  CBC (Cipher block chaining), CTR (Counter), XTS (XEX with ciphertext stealing),

  GCM (Galois Counter Mode).


  The AES implementation uses AES-NI when available (on x86 and x86-64 architecture),

  but fallback gracefully to a software C implementation.


  The software implementation uses S-Boxes, which might suffer for cache timing issues.

  However do notes that most other known software implementations, including very
  popular

  one (openssl, gnutls) also uses similar implementation. If it matters for your

  case, you should make sure you have AES-NI available, or you''ll need to use a different

  implementation.

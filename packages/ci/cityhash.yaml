description: ! 'This package implements a binding to the CityHash family of hashing
  functions (implemented in C++.)


  See <http://code.google.com/p/cityhash/> for more information.


  This package has optional SSE4.2 support. If you build it with the @-fsse42@ flag,
  the 128-bit

  hashing functions will use an SSE-optimized implementation (which takes advantage
  of the @crc32@

  instruction present on recent Intel/AMD machines.) The 64-bit hashing functions
  are unaffected.'

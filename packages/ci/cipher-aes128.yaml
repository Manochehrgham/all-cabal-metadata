description: ! 'Cipher-aes128 is an implementation of AES and common modes of operation.  It
  borrows Hanquez''s C AES code (see ''cipher-aes'') but

  is unique due to including compile-time detection of

  NI compiler support, a slightly more functional interface

  for GCM operations, exposure of ''Ptr'' based operations via the .Internal module,
  and build-in crypto-api support.

  Cipher-aes128 was originally developed as "''cipher-aes'' plus trampolines", which
  has since been adopted into cipher-aes.'

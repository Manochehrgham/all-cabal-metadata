description: ! 'Given a number of circles with their radii, this packags

  tries to arrange them tightly, without overlap and forming a

  large circle.


  Finding the optimal solution is NP hard, so only

  heuristics are feasible. This particular

  implementation is neither very good nor very fast,

  compared to the state of the art in research. Nevertheless

  it is simple to use and gives visually acceptable results.


  Contributions of better algorithms are welcome.'

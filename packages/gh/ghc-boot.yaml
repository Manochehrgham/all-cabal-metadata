description: ! 'This library is shared between GHC, ghc-pkg, and other boot

  libraries.


  A note about "GHC.PackageDb": it only deals with the subset of

  the package database that the compiler cares about: modules

  paths etc and not package metadata like description, authors

  etc. It is thus not a library interface to ghc-pkg and is *not*

  suitable for modifying GHC package databases.


  The package database format and this library are constructed in

  such a way that while ghc-pkg depends on Cabal, the GHC library

  and program do not have to depend on Cabal.'

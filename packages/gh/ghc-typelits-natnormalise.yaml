description: ! 'A type checker plugin for GHC that can solve /equalities/ of types
  of kind

  @Nat@, where these types are either:


  * Type-level naturals


  * Type variables


  * Applications of the arithmetic expressions @(+,-,*,^)@.


  It solves these equalities by normalising them to /sort-of/ @SOP@

  (Sum-of-Products) form, and then perform a simple syntactic equality.


  For example, this solver can prove the equality between:


  @

  (x + 2)^(y + 2)

  @


  and


  @

  4*x*(2 + x)^y + 4*(2 + x)^y + (2 + x)^y*x^2

  @


  Because the latter is actually the @SOP@ normal form of the former.


  To use the plugin, add the


  @

  OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin GHC.TypeLits.Normalise

  @


  Pragma to the header of your file.'

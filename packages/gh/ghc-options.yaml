description: ! '''ghcopts'' is a library that makes it easy to determine what

  GHC options are needed to compile a file. It was built

  by extracting the relevant code from ''hdevtools'' which

  queries ''cabal'' and ''stack'' to determine the locations

  of various package databases, in order to pass them to

  GHC to process a target file. We have refactored this

  code into a separate package so that it can be used by

  other tools built on the GHC API.'

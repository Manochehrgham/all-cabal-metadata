description: ! 'This package provides a generic Core-to-Core pass for

  annotating Haskell expressions with the original source

  locations, making them available at runtime.


  You can use it to build a GHC Plugin tailored to

  your own library by providing a predicate to select

  interesting expressions for annotation and a function to

  annotate the expressions.'

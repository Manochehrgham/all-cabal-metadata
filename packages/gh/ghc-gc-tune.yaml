description: ! 'ghc-gc-tune runs your compiled Haskell program with

  different GC flags, and generates a graph of time as

  those GC settings vary. ghc-gc-tune lets your automate

  the task of finding good GC flags for your program, in

  order to get the best performance from it.


  Graphs are rendered with gnuplot, so make sure that is

  installed.


  Example use:


  > ghc -O2 --make binarytrees.hs

  > ghc-gc-tune -t svg binarytrees 12


  Example output:

description: ! 'A tiny package that combines the ipprint package and

  the hscolour package to provide colored pretty-printing

  in ghci.


  /Usage/


  Add the following lines to your @ghci.conf@ file:


  > -- Pretty printing of it

  > import IPPrint.Colored

  > :set -interactive-print=IPPrint.Colored.cpprint

  > :def cp (\_ -> return ":set -interactive-print=IPPrint.Colored.cpprint")

  > :def ncp (\_ -> return ":set -interactive-print=print")


  Now you can enable colored pretty-printing in ghci with the commmand


  > :cp


  The following command turns colored pretty-printing off again


  > :ncp'

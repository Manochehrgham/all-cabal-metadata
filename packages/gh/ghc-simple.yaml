description: ! 'The GHC API is a great tool for working with Haskell code.

  Unfortunately, it''s also fairly opaque and hard to get

  started with. This library abstracts away the intricacies

  of working with the GHC API, giving a general, no-nonsense

  way to extract highly optimized (or not, depending on your

  use case) Core, STG, custom intermediate code, and other

  information from Haskell code.'

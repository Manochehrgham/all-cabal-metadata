description: ! 'The @ghc-make@ program can be used as a drop-in replacement for @ghc@.
  This program

  targets two use cases:


  * If a flag such as @-j4@ is passed, the modules will be compiled in parallel.

  If the available parallelism is greater than a factor of 3, the build will probably
  run faster.


  * If there is no work to do (i.e. the compiled files are up-to-date), the build
  will run faster,

  sometimes significantly so.


  See the readme for full details: <https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghc-make#readme>.'

description: ! '''ghc-parmake'' is a parallel wrapper for ''ghc --make''

  intended to work as its drop-in replacement. It can

  build your Haskell program in parallel using multiple

  cores.

  ''ghc-parmake'' works by extracting a module dependency

  graph with ''ghc -M'' and then running multiple ''ghc -c''

  processes in parallel.

  To set the number of concurrent jobs, use the ''-j''

  option.'

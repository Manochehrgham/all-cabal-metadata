description: ! 'Using the API Annotations available from GHC 7.10 RC2, this

  library provides a means to round trip any* code that can

  be compiled by GHC


  * any currently excludes anything using CPP or lhs.


  The dependency footprint is deliberately kept small so that

  it can easily be tested against GHC HEAD


  Note: requires GHC 7.10 RC2 or later'

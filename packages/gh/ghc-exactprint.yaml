synopsis: ExactPrint for GHC
changelog: ! "2015-03-24 v0.2\n\tThis release contains a major rewrite of all internal
  modules.\n\n\tThe external interface has also changed significantly. A description
  is\n\tomitted.\n\n\t# Top-level changes\n\tThe most notable change is that the common
  structor of the modules known as\n\t`ExactPrint` and `Annotate` has been factored
  out into a common module\n\t(`Annotate`). The aforementioned modules are now known
  as `Delta` and\n\t`Print` and contain functions to interpret this common structure.\n\n\tThe
  top level module `ExactPrint` now just reexports a consistent interface\n\tfrom
  the base modules.\n\n\tIntroduced a new module `Lookup` which contains a mapping
  from AnnKeywordId\n\tto their String representation.\n\n\t# Internal Changes\n\n\t`Annotate`
  contains all the information about which annotations appear on\n\teach AST element.
  This is achieved by building up a syntax tree (using a\n\tfree monad) which can
  then be interpreted by programs requiring access to\n\tthis information.\n\n\t#
  Layout compensation\n\n\tThe method which compensates for layout rules has been
  clarified.\n\n\t\t1. When the Layout Flag is activated in `Annotate`, we mark\n\tthe
  current column as the start of the layout block.\n\n\t\t2. This is important when
  we move to a new line. We take the offset at\n\t\tthat current point to be the baseline
  and calculate the correct next\n\t\tposition based on this.\n\n\t\t3. This method
  is very general as one can think of a entire source file as\n\t\tobeying layout
  rules where the offset is equal to zero.\n\n\n2015-03-11 v0.1.1.0\n\tHandles indentation
  when the AST is edited\n\tMajor rework of internal monads by @mpickering\n2015-01-28
  v0.1.0.1\n\tUpdate cabal to prevent building with GHC 7.70,thanks @peti\n2015-01-24
  v0.1.0.0\n\tInitial release, for GHC 7.10 RC 2\n"

description: ! 'Using the API Annotations available from GHC 7.10 RC2, this

  library provides a means to round trip any* code that can

  be compiled by GHC


  * any currently excludes anything using CPP or lhs.


  The dependency footprint is deliberately kept small so that

  it can easily be tested against GHC HEAD


  Note: requires GHC 7.10 RC2 or later'

description: ! 'This package provides unary type level representations of the

  (positive and negative) integers and basic operations (addition,

  subtraction, multiplication, division) on these.

  Due to the unary implementation the practical size of the

  NumTypes is severely limited making them unsuitable for

  large-cardinality applications. If you will be working with

  integers beyond (-20, 20) this package probably isn''t for you.

  The numtype-tf packade differs from the numtype package in that

  the NumTypes are implemented using type families rather than

  functional dependencies.

  Requires GHC 7.0 or later.'

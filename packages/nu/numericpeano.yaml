description: ! 'Value-level lazy Peano numbers for all your proof-theoretic

  and infinity-related needs. The features are:

  1) natural and integral numbers (N and Z);

  2) lazy infinities; and

  3) instances for all relevant typeclasses, meaning that

  Peano arithmetic can be used in generic functions without

  extra hassle.

  The implementation is naive: a number of

  magnitude n may consume O(n) bytes of memory.'

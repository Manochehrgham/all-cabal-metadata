description: ! 'The Nussinov78 RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm

  using the ADPfusion framework.


  This algorithm is simple enough to be used as a tutorial-type

  example. It also shows that efficient code is possible. The

  ADPfusion code compared to C is slower by a factor of only 1.2.

  We plan to improve upon this.


  A number of helper functions currently present in

  BioInf.Nussinov78 will later move in their own library.


  Build using GHC-7.6.1, the new code generator and llvm for best

  performance.


  For comparison, a version of the algorithm written in C is

  available under C/nussinov.c. Use at least

  "gcc -O3 nussinov.c".'

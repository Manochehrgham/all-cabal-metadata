description: ! 'This package provides type level representations of the

  (positive and negative) integers and basic operations (addition,

  subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation) on these.

  The numtype-dk package differs from the numtype package in that

  the NumTypes are implemented using Data Kinds, TypeNats, and

  Closed Type Families rather than Functional Dependencies.

  Requires GHC 7.8 or later.'

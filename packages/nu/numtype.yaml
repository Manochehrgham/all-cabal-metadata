description: ! 'This package provides unary type level representations of the

  (positive and negative) integers and basic operations (addition,

  subtraction, multiplication, division) on these.

  Due to the unary implementation the practical size of the

  NumTypes is severely limited making them unsuitable for

  large-cardinality applications. If you will be working with

  integers beyond (-20, 20) this package probably isn''t for you.

  It is, however, eminently suitable for applications such as

  representing physical dimensions (see the ''Dimensional'' library).

  Requires GHC 6.6.1 or later.'

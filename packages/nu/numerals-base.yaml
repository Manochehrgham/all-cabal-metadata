description: ! 'This package contains machinery to construct functions that convert

  numbers to number words. It allows you to write a function which

  converts a number like 142 to the string \"one hundred and

  forty-two\".


  The documentation for the "Text.Numeral" module contains an high

  level overview of the package.


  If you just want to convert numbers to number words in a specific

  language you should probably use the @numerals@ package. That

  package also contains numerous examples on how to use the functions

  in this package.'

description: ! 'Package provides function to perform numeric integration and

  differentiation, function interpolation.


  Changes in 0.2.0.0


  * Equation solvers now use custom return type.


  * Function to solve equations using Ridder and Newton methods.


  * New function to test approximate equality for doubles.


  * QuadRes contains best approximation achieved even if required

  accuracy is not obtained


  * Improve convergence test when integral converges to

  zero. Convergence is still poor'

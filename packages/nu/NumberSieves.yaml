description: This package includes the Sieve of O'Neill and two generalizations of
  the Sieve of Eratosthenes.   The Sieve of O'Neill is a fully incremental primality
  sieve based on priority queues.  The other two are array based, and are not incremental.   One
  sieves the smallest prime factor,  and is useful if you want to factor a large quantity
  of small numbers.   The other sieves Euler's Totient,  which is the number of positive
  integers relatively prime and less than a given number.

  \n\nA `Range` a is a tuple representing an interval of a number space.  A Range
  can be thought of as consisting of a low and high value, though `low <= high` isn't
  strictly enforced, allowing a negative space so to speak. The library uses the 'NumHask'
  classes and thus most of the usual arithmetic operators can be used.\n\nThe library
  includes modules for:\n\n- `Rect`: rectangles, which are 2 dimensional ranges.  This
  is very useful for diagrams\n- `Hist`: histograms.  This may sound strange but buckets
  of a histogram is nothing more than a collection of contiguous `Ranges` with extra
  information for each bucket.\n"

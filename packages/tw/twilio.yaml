description: This package exports bindings to Twilio's REST API (<https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest>).
  While we would like to have a complete binding to Twilio's REST API, this package
  is being developed on demand. If you need something that has not been implemented
  yet, please send a pull request or file an issue on GitHub (<https://github.com/markandrus/twilio-haskell>).

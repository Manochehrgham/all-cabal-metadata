description: ! 'This is twee, a prover for equational problems.


  To install, run cabal install.


  Afterwards, invoke as twee nameofproblem.p. The problem should be in

  TPTP format (http://www.tptp.org). You can find a few examples in the

  tests directory. All axioms and conjectures must be equations, but you

  can freely use types and quantifiers.


  Twee is experimental software, use at your own risk!

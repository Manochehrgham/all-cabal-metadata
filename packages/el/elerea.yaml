synopsis: A minimalistic FRP library
changelog: ! "2.8.0 - 140122\n* added MonadIO and MonadBase instances for SignalGen
  (Mitsutoshi Aoe)\n\n2.7.0.2 - 120401\n* added some inlining annotations (courtesy
  of Takano Akio)\n\n2.7.0.1 - 120131\n* made externalMulti thread-safe (courtesy
  of Takano Akio)\n\n2.7.0 - 111223\n* fixed an issue with nested signal creations
  not updating properly\n  (courtesy of Takano Akio)\n* added reference implementation
  for the simple variant\n\n2.6.0 - 111211\n* added snapshot to all variants, which
  allows sampling signals within\n  signal generators\n\n2.5.0 - 111122\n* added SignalGen
  liftIO equivalent to assist library writers\n* simplified the signatures of effectful*
  combinators\n* updated Param to use the more modern codebase (like Simple and\n
  \ Clocked); this was necessary to support effectful signals\n* temporarily removed
  the static optimisation from Param\n* removed dependency on mersenne-random\n* removed
  legacy branch\n\n2.4.0 - 111111\n* added effectful signals to assist library writers\n\n2.3.0
  - 110627\n* reimplemented clocked variant in a correct and more efficient way\n\n2.2.0
  - 110402\n* added n-ary transfer functions\n* temporarily removed transfer from
  the clocked variant\n* revised documentation\n\n2.1.0 - 100805\n* reimplemented
  the parametric variant in a way that doesn't require\n  signals to carry the type
  of the parameter any more\n* added the ability to extract the global input in the
  parametric\n  variant, and also to override it (input and embed, resp.)\n* added
  until to be able to define switchers that can truly drop\n  references to old signals\n*
  added debug printing capability to the simple and clocked variants\n* made a note
  about possibly deprecating the delayed variant\n\n2.0.0 - 100718\n* moved experimental
  branch to the top (version 1 went into legacy\n  status)\n* added the clocked variant\n\n1.2.3
  - 100131\n* added externalMulti to handle events that can fire several times\n  within
  a superstep\n* added a cache to the noise signal for safety reasons, so it lives
  in\n  SignalGen now\n\n1.2.2 - 100115\n* added noise signals and the getRandom primitive
  (using mersenne-random)\n\n1.2.1 - 091204\n* modified the &&@ and ||@ operators
  to short-circuit\n\n1.2.0 - 091202\n* added the delayed variant to the experimental
  branch\n* renamed storeJust to (-->) in the experimental branch\n\n1.1.0 - 091126\n*
  added experimental branch with a cleaner semantics\n\n1.0.0 - 090726\n* completely
  renewed interface by introducing the SignalMonad\n\n0.6.0 - 090507\n* renamed Void
  to StartToken\n* replaced restarter with the simpler and more versatile startTokens\n\n0.5.0
  - 090502\n* changed names of internal constructors to match primitives better\n*
  added restarter and (==>)\n* removed the unused type synonym Time\n\n0.4.0 - 090501\n*
  added keepAlive\n* made delay a primitive\n* completely separated sampling and aging\n\n0.3.0
  - 090419\n* documentation bug fixed: the latcher is not delayed\n* added dot (Graphviz)
  converter\n\n0.2.0 - 090412\n* removed primitives time and stateless\n* removed
  default delay on stateful combinators and added experimental\n  cycle detection\n*
  added some non-primitive combinators: delay, edge, comparisons,\n  logic relations\n*
  added signal instances for various numeric classes\n\n0.1.0 - 090410\n* first public
  version\n"

description: ! 'Elerea (Eventless reactivity) is a tiny discrete time FRP

  implementation without the notion of event-based switching and

  sampling, with first-class signals (time-varying values).  Reactivity

  is provided through various higher-order constructs that also allow

  the user to work with arbitrary time-varying structures containing

  live signals.  Signals have precise and simple denotational

  semantics.


  Stateful signals can be safely generated at any time through a

  monadic interface, while stateless combinators can be used in a

  purely applicative style.  Elerea signals can be defined recursively,

  and external input is trivial to attach.  The library comes in three

  major variants:


  * Simple: signals are plain discrete streams isomorphic to functions

  over natural numbers;


  * Param: adds a globally accessible input signal for convenience;


  * Clocked: adds the ability to freeze whole subnetworks at will.


  This is a minimal library that defines only some basic primitives,

  and you are advised to install @elerea-examples@ as well to get an

  idea how to build non-trivial systems with it.  The examples are

  separated in order to minimise the dependencies of the core library.

  The @dow@ package contains a full game built on top of the simple

  variant.


  The basic idea of the implementation is described in the WFLP 2010

  paper /Efficient and Compositional Higher-Order Streams/

  (<http://sgate.emt.bme.hu/documents/patai/publications/PataiWFLP2010.pdf>).

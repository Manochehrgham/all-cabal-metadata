description: ! 'Example applications for Elerea. They are factored out into their

  own package so as to avoid unnecessary dependencies in the

  library. Check out the @doc@ directory for the colourful literate

  sources.


  The programs included are the following:


  * bounce: an example for creating dynamic collections of signals;

  left click to create balls, drag existing balls with left button

  to propel them and drag with right to select balls for deletion

  (upon release);


  * chase: a minimal example that demonstrates reactivity and mutually

  recursive signals;


  * breakout: a not too fancy breakout clone; you can simply use the

  mouse to move the paddle.'

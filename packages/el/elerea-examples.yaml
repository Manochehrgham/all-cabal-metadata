description: ! "Example applications for Elerea. They are factored out into their
  own\npackage so as to avoid unnecessary dependencies in the library. Check\nout
  the doc directory for the colourful literate sources.\n\nThe programs included are
  the following:\n\n* bounce: an example for creating dynamic collections of signals;
  left\n  click to create balls, drag existing balls with left button to\n  propel
  them and drag with right to select balls for deletion (upon\n  release);\n\n* chase:
  a minimal example that demonstrates reactivity and mutually\n  recursive signals;\n\n*
  breakout: a not too fancy breakout clone; you can simply use the\n  mouse to move
  the paddle.\n"

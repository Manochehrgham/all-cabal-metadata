description: ! 'The ''Par'' monad offers a simple API for parallel programming.  The

  library works for parallelising both pure and @IO@ computations,

  although only the pure version is deterministic.  The default

  implementation provides a work-stealing scheduler and supports

  forking tasks that are much lighter weight than IO-threads.


  For complete documentation see "Control.Monad.Par".


  Some examples of use can be found in the @examples/@ directory of

  the source package.


  Other related packages:


  * @abstract-par@ provides the type classes that abstract over different

  implementations of the @Par@ monad.


  * @monad-par-extras@ provides extra combinators and monad transformers layered on
  top of

  the @Par@ monad.


  Changes in 0.3.4 relative to 0.3:


  * Fix bugs that cause "thread blocked indefinitely on MVar" crashes.


  * Added "Control.Monad.Par.IO"'

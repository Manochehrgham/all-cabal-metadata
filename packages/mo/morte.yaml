description: ! 'Morte is a typed, purely functional, and strongly normalizing

  intermediate language designed for whole-program super-optimization.  Use

  this library to type-check, optimize, parse, pretty-print, serialize and

  deserialize expressions in this intermediate language.


  This library also installs an executable that you can use to type-check and

  optimize a @morte@ program.


  "Morte.Core" contains the core calculus of constructions for this language


  "Morte.Lexer" contains the @alex@-generated lexer for Morte


  "Morte.Parser" contains the @happy@-generated parser for Morte


  Read "Morte.Tutorial" to learn how to use this library'

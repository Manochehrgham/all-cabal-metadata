description: ! 'Moo library provides building blocks to build custom

  genetic algorithms in Haskell. They can be used to

  find solutions to optimization and search problems.


  Variants supported out of the box: binary (using

  bit-strings) and continuous (real-coded).

  Potentially supported variants: permutation,

  tree, hybrid encodings (require customizations).


  Binary GAs: binary and Gray encoding; point mutation;

  one-point, two-point, and uniform crossover.

  Continuous GAs: Gaussian mutation; BLX-Î±, UNDX, and

  SBX crossover.

  Selection operators: roulette, and tournament;

  with optional niching and scaling.

  Replacement strategies: generational with elitism

  and steady state.

  Constrained optimization: random constrained

  initialization, death penalty, constrained

  selection without a penalty function.

  Multi-objective optimization: NSGA-II

  and constrained NSGA-II.'

description: ! 'This package defines @MonadPeelIO@, a subset of @MonadIO@ into which

  generic control operations such as @catch@ can be lifted from @IO@.

  Instances are based on monad transformers in @MonadTransPeel@, which

  includes all standard monad transformers in the @transformers@

  library except @ContT@.  For convenience, it provides a wrapped

  version of Control.Exception with types generalized from @IO@ to all

  monads in @MonadPeelIO@.'

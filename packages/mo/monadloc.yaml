description: ! 'This package defines a class for monads which can keep a monadic call
  trace.


  * See the blog post <http://pepeiborra.wordpress.com/2009/11/01/monadic-stack-traces-that-make-a-lot-of-sense>
  for more information.


  A preprocessor is available (see the package monadloc-pp) which inserts calls

  to "Control.Monad.Loc.withLoc" before every monadic statement in a module.

  To invoke the preprocessor, add the pragma @OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF MonadLoc@  at the
  top of your Haskell files  together with an import for the "Control.Monad.Loc" module


  This package provides no implementation of the "Control.Monad.Loc.MonadLoc" interface.

  Currently the only package that does so is @control-monad-exception@,

  but any other package can implement it and provide monadic call traces.

  /Changes/:


  * 0.7 - Extracted Template Haskell macro to separate module to allow @Control.Monad.Loc@
  to be Safe. (thanks to Deian Stefan)


  * 0.6 - Extracted the preprocessor to a separate package @monadloc-pp@ to minimize
  the set of dependencies.'

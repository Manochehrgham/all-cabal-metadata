description: ! 'Overloaded ''get'' and ''put'' for state variables (''IORef'', ''STRef'',
  ''TVar'')

  to make reading and writing more concise.


  Inspired by the StateVar package by Sven Panne, with the following

  differences:


  * Supports variables in other monads besides ''IO'' (e.g. ''TVar'', ''STRef'').


  * Provides non-infix ''put'', ''modify'', etc.


  * Does not provide concrete state variables (i.e. ones where you supply

  get and put callbacks).  If you want this feature, please submit an

  issue.


  * Named \"Control.Monad.StateVar\" instead of \"Data.StateVar\",

  to avoid a module naming conflict.'

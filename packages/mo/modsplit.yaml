description: ! 'The "modsplit" program takes a (most likely auto-generated) single-module

  Haskell source file containing specifically formatted comments and

  splits it into several modules according to the directives

  contained in the special comments.


  This program has its roots in HSFFIG, and the format of these

  comments is described here:


  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HSFFIG/Tutorial#Splitting_large_modules>


  This program is intended to post-process the output of programs generating

  Haskell code rather than to deal with handwritten code.


  Special comment values are exported by this package in order to simplify

  writing of programs that use the splitter. See the documentation for

  the "Data.SplitBounds" module.'

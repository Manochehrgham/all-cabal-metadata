description: ! 'This module provides a Class called @MonadBi@ which acts as a superset

  of @MonadTrans@, and provides @raise@ analogous to @lift@,

  i.e. lifts underlying monads into the transformer. It also provides

  @lower@ which is the opposite of @lift@, and extracts underlying monads from monad
  transformers.

  Generally speaking, MonadBi represents the relationship between monads that can
  be transformed into each other (atleast partially).

  Natural instances are provided for many Monad Transformers.'

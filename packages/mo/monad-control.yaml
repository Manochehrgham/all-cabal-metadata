description: ! 'This package defines the type class @MonadBaseControl@, a subset of

  @MonadBase@ into which generic control operations such as @catch@ can be

  lifted from @IO@ or any other base monad. Instances are based on monad

  transformers in @MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad

  transformers in the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.


  See the @lifted-base@ package which uses @monad-control@ to lift @IO@

  operations from the @base@ library (like @catch@ or @bracket@) into any monad

  that is an instance of @MonadBase@ or @MonadBaseControl@.


  Note that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg''s @monad-peel@

  library. The main difference is that this package provides CPS style operators

  and exploits the @RankNTypes@ and @TypeFamilies@ language extensions to

  simplify and speedup most definitions.'

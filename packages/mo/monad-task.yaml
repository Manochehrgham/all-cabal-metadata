description: ! 'Task monad transformer can help refactor event and callback

  heavy programs into monads via co-routines. The idea is loosely

  based on /Combining Events And Threads For Scalable Network Services/,

  by Peng Li and Steve Zdancewic, in /PLDI/, 2007.

  (<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/papers/abstracts.html#LZ07>), but

  with deterministic and co-oprative lightweight threads, also known as

  co-routines, so that the base monad can be anything ranging from IO

  to state monads, or your favorite monad transformer stack.'

description: ! 'A monad and transformer for performing Monte Carlo

  calculations. This monad carries and provides access to

  a pseudo-random number generator. Internally, the monad

  mutates rather than copies the random gnerator state.  By

  avoiding copies, it can deliver faster performance than

  many pure random number implementations.  The package is

  built around the facilities provided by the GNU Scientific

  Library (GSL).'

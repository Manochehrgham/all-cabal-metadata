description: ! 'The goal of this library is to simplify implementation and use of

  state-space estimation algorithms, such as Kalman Filters. The

  interface for constructing models is isolated as much as possible from

  the specifics of a given algorithm, so swapping out a Kalman Filter

  for a Bayesian Particle Filter should involve a minimum of effort.


  This implementation is designed to support symbolic types, such as

  from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv sbv> or

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ivory ivory>. As a result you can

  generate code in another language, such as C, from a model written

  using this package; or run static analyses on your model.


  Also included is a sophisticated sensor fusion example in

  "Numeric.Estimator.Model.SensorFusion", which may be useful in its own

  right.'

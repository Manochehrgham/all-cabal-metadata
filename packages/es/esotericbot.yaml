description: ! 'Esotericbot is a sophisticated, lightweight IRC bot, written in Haskell.


  Esotericbot launches sub-processes to respond to commands issued by users over IRC.


  Why would you use esotericbot?


  For lambdabot-4.2.2.1:


  spoon@utensil:~/esotericbot$ ps e v


  PID TTY      STAT   TIME  MAJFL   TRS   DRS   RSS %MEM COMMAND


  23433 pts/3    Sl+    0:00      0  8228 84855 33476  1.6 lambdabot


  15040 pts/5    S+     0:00      0  2171 28804  3292  0.1 ./esotericbot


  I''m not insinuating that lambdabot sucks in any way, ( lambdabot is most excellent
  ) however, my hope is that esotericbot could attain equal functionality through
  plugins, while maintaining its small memory footprint.


  Esotericbot is small ( for Haskell :), designed to run on a server with limited
  memory - typically running at under 5mb of private memory.


  Features:


  * Advanced memory and time management options, utilizing POSIX resource management.


  For example, the memory used by all child processes, can be limited - commands be
  queued until the memory usage has dropped.


  * Privileged channel operator commands ( Currently, can be disabled and enabled
  by channel operators, to prevent abuse. )


  * Easy to add new plugins.  A C library is included to make writing new plugins/adapting
  programs to be plugins easy.


  * Set up through a configuration file.


  * Multiple channels.


  * Multi-threaded


  * Lightweight, typically running at under 5mb of private memory.


  Cons:


  * POSIX memory management, process forking, and chroot means that Esotericbot is
  POSIX only.


  * Esotericbot is, due to the libraries and extensions used, restricted to being
  compiled by the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler.



  Note: esotericbot comes with several plugins which will be installed into your cabal-bin,
  and libraries installed into your cabal-lib.  Check cabal-bin for ''brainfuck'',
  ''unlambda'' , ''malbolge'', ''sk'' and ''whirl''.  These will need libplugin and
  libplugin++ from your cabal-lib to function correctly.'

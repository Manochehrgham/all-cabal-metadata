description: ! 'Simple, Incremental SAT Solving as a Library

  ============================================


  This Haskell library provides an implementation of the

  Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm

  (cf. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm>) for the boolean

  satisfiability problem. It not only allows to solve boolean formulas

  in one go but also to add constraints and query bindings of variables

  incrementally.


  The implementation is not sophisticated at all but uses the basic DPLL

  algorithm with unit propagation.

description: ! 'A networked game with client-server architecture. The core game is
  a

  lockpicking-themed turn-based puzzle game on a hex grid. Players design

  puzzles (locks) and solve those designed by others. A metagame encourages

  the design of maximally difficult puzzles, within tight size constraints.

  The client supports Curses and SDL, with all graphics in SDL mode drawn by

  code using SDL-gfx. The network protocol is based on the ''binary'' package,

  and is intended to be reasonably efficient. TVars are used to give

  transparent local caching and background network operations. Also

  incorporates an implementation of a graph 5-colouring algorithm (see

  GraphColouring.hs).'

description: ! 'Representations and operations for bidirectional arrows (total isomorphisms:
  an

  arrow paired with its inverse).  Classes for invariant functors and monoidal

  functors.  Includes a number of useful bijections and operations, as well as

  interoperability with related packages.


  Most users will want to import one or more of "Data.Invertible" qualified, "Control.Invertible.Monoidal"
  unqualified, and any additional compatibility modules.'

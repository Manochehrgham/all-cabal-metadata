description: ! 'Inch is a type-checker for a subset of Haskell (plus some GHC

  extensions) with the addition of integer constraints. After

  successfully type-checking a source file, it outputs an

  operationally equivalent version with the type-level integers

  erased, so it can be used as a preprocessor in order to compile

  programs.'

description: ! 'INblobs is a visual tool developed at Minho for integrated development
  with

  Interaction Nets (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets>).

  INblobs includes a visual editor that allows users to edit both interaction

  nets and interaction rules; nets may then be reduced within the tool, or

  else exported in a text format to be given as input to other tools.'

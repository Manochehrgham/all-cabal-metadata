description: This library implements /counted lists/ linked to type-level naturals
  indexing length, compatible with the Peano natural numbers found in "Data.Numeric.Witness.Peano",
  as well as so-called /conic lists/, which are linked to a type index listing the
  type indices of partially-heterogeneous values contained within.

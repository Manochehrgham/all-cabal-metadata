description: ! 'This library provides persistent, time and space efficient integer

  sets implemented as dense big-endian patricia trees with buddy

  suffixes compaction. In randomized settings this structure expected

  to be as fast as Data.IntSet from containers, but if a sets is

  likely to have long continuous intervals it should be much faster.'

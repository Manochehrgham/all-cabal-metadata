description: ! 'GHC has no capability to perform graph searches on instance definition.
  Because of that,

  transitive rules for type classes cannot be defined. This package solves the issue
  with

  type functions performing a search on the graph where nodes are types and edges
  are

  rules from a given rule database. After constructing the type-level representation
  of the

  wanted path, the system constructs the needed functions from the value-level representation

  of the database.'

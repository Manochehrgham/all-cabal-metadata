description: ! 'This version is highly experimental and may set your computer on fire
  (also, a lot of JS is not supported yet, so it may not be very useful.)


  Infernu is a type checker for JavaScript. Since JavaScript is dynamically and weakly
  typed, it makes no sense to talk about "type errors" in arbitrary JavaScript code.


  Consequently Infernu makes assumptions about the code and expects it to follow certain
  rules that

  are not required by plain JavaScript (for example, implicit coercions such as `3
  + ''a''` are not

  allowed.)


  Infernu''s type system is designed for writing dynamic-looking code in a safe statically
  type-checked

  environment. Type annotations are not required (though they would be nice to support,
  for various

  reasons). Instead, Infernu *infers* the types of expressions by examining the code.
  If the inferred

  types contradict each other, Infernu reports the contradiction as an error.


  Infernu places restrictions on JS programs that are otherwise valid. In other words,
  Infernu is a

  **subset of JavaScript**. Infernu tries to strike a balance between type system
  complexity and

  dynamic-style coding flexibility.

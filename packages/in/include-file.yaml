description: ! 'Inclusion of files in source code via Template Haskell.


  When distributing executables, sometimes it is required

  to attach some other resources in files. Using this library

  (together with the TemplateHaskell extension) you avoid this

  problem by including those files inside the executable at

  compile time.'

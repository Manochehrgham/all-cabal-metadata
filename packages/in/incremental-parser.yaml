description: ! 'This package defines yet another parser library. This one is implemented
  using the concept of Brzozowski derivatives,

  tweaked and optimized to work with any monoidal input type. Lists, ByteString, and
  Text are supported out of the box,

  as well as any other data type for which the monoid-subclasses package defines instances.

  If the parser result is also a monoid, the parser can provide it incrementally,
  before the complete input is parsed.'

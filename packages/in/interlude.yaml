description: ! 'Interlude is a CPP include file, and a module which you can use instead
  of the

  (often implicit) Prelude import.  It replaces some partial

  functions (i.e. functions that may fail on correctly typed input like ''head []'')

  with pattern matches, so that a sensible error message that includes

  location can be printed out.'

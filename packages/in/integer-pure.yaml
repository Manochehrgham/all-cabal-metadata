description: ! 'A pure-Haskell implementation of the arbitrary-precision Integer

  numeric type.  Originally developed for a compiler that does not

  supply a builtin Integer type, this package could also be useful

  for people who want to avoid ghc''s builtin integer-gmp for

  licencing reasons.'

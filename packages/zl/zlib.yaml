description: ! 'This package provides a pure interface for compressing and

  decompressing streams of data represented as lazy

  ''ByteString''s. It uses the zlib C library so it has high

  performance. It supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\"

  compression formats.


  It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most

  tasks and for the few cases where more control is needed it

  provides access to the full zlib feature set.'

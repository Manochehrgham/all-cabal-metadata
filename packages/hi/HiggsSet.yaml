description: ! 'This package allows you to define several typesafe

  indizes on a set. You can query the set with an SQL-like

  set of query operations.

  This package was developed as a successor of ''Data.IxSet''.

  It is meant to be more space efficient, since it uses

  ''Data.IntSet'' and ''Data.TrieMap'' as an underlying represenation.

  It also has the potential to be fast, since indizes don''t

  need to be recalculated after each query and since

  Patricia trees perform quite well for intersection and union.

  This package comes without warranties. Although I use it

  without problems in a large web project it is neither properly

  tested nor benchmarked.

  Patches or suggestions for improvement are welcome. If you like,

  start an issue on github.'

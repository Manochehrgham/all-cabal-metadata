description: ! 'The library provides a simple embedded domain specific language for

  defining transliteration rules.

  Additionally, the library includes a set of rules prepared (within the SYNAT

  project) for documents collected throughout the IMPACT project (available

  at <http://dl.psnc.pl/activities/projekty/impact/results/>).


  A transliteration system, developed independently within the IMPACT

  project, may be also of interest.

  It can be found at <https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/pol>.'

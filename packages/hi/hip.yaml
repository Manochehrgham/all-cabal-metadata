description: ! '

  Haskell Image Processing (HIP) Library provides an easy to use interface with a
  whole variaty of image manipulation capabilities.


  Processing can be done sequentially as well as in parallel, with an inherited fusion
  capabily, all through <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa repa> and <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector
  vector> packages. It is highly extendable, with an ability to add custom color spaces
  or use some other underlying data structure.


  It is capable of reading and writing a number of popular image formats by using
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/JuicyPixels JuciyPixels> and <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/netpbm
  netpbm> packages. Being a pure Haskell library it does not require any external
  programs, although it can display images using a program of your choice.'

description: ! 'This package provides an executable which reads from

  stdin and outputs the same thing to stdout,

  except that any lines which look like package

  identifiers (e.g. foo-0.3.2) are highlighted:

  red if the version is less than the

  version on Hackage, green if equal,

  or cyan if greater.  In

  addition, when the versions are unequal the

  Hackage version is shown in blue.


  In particular, it can be useful to pipe the

  output of @cabal(-dev) install --dry-run@ through

  this program, to aid in checking the install

  plan. It''s usually a good idea to understand why

  an outdated package is being installed; otherwise

  it can indicate that something needs to be updated.


  PLEASE NOTE that highlight-versions does not

  actually consult Hackage, but rather your local

  index of Hackage cached by cabal. You must call

  ''cabal update'' to be sure that

  highlight-versions has access to the latest

  information about package versions on Hackage.'

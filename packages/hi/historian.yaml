description: ! 'Extract interesting commands and add them to a text file.

  \"Interesting\" means not matching any regular expression in the

  file. This allows one to keep a textual database of commands.

  Never again say \"I wish I remembered what arguments to give

  wibble to make it flibber the gibbet\" three months after you

  looked it up.

  WARNING: historian truncates ~/.bash_history.'

description: ! 'Hieraclus is a library that supports clustering of arbitrary elements
  in haskell. The

  difference to the already existing cluster library "hierarchical-clustering" is
  the ability

  to work with abort criterias which allow an "intelligent" clustering. With the help
  of

  abort criterias the user can specify conditions that must be fulfilled in order
  to stop

  the clustering process.'

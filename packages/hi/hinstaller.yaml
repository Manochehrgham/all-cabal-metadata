description: ! 'This module allows you to incorporate arbitrary files into a haskell
  module

  during compilation. The files are then available to you through functions

  which allows you to write installer-type applications which write out the

  files when run. Thus this can be considered in the same model as Java .jar

  files or executable zip or other file archives.


  The current implementation is now reasonably efficient. However, it does

  require that you have a C compiler installed which can be invoked through

  @cc@.'

  Fast non-backtracking incremental combinator parsing for bytestrings


  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Yuras/scanner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Yuras/scanner)


  On hackage: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scanner


  It is often convinient to use backtracking to parse some sophisticated

  input. Unfortunately it kills performance, so usually you should avoid

  backtracking.


  Often (actually always, but it could be too hard sometimes) you can

  implement your parser without any backtracking. It that case all the

  bookkeeping usuall parser combinators do becomes unnecessary. The

  scanner library is designed for such cases. It is often 2 times faster

  then attoparsec.


  As an example, please checkout redis protocol parser included into the

  repo, both using attoparsec and scanner libraries:

  https://github.com/Yuras/scanner/tree/master/examples/Redis


  Benchmark results:

  But if you really really really need backtracking, then you can just

  inject attoparsec parser into a scanner: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scanner-attoparsec

description: ! 'SCC is a layered library of Streaming Component Combinators. The lowest
  layer in "Control.Concurent.SCC.Streams"

  defines stream abstractions and nested producer-consumer coroutine pairs based on
  the Coroutine monad transformer.

  On top of that are streaming component types, a number of primitive streaming components
  and a set of component

  combinators. Finally, there is an executable that exposes all the framework functionality
  in a command-line shell.


  The original library design is based on paper <http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2006/Blazevic01/EML2006Blazevic01.html>


  Mario Bla&#382;evi&#263;, Streaming component combinators, Extreme Markup Languages,
  2006.'

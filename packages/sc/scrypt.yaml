description: ! 'This package provides bindings to Colin Percival''s `scrypt`

  implementation (<http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html>). Scrypt is a key

  derivation function designed to be far more secure against hardware

  brute-force attacks than alternative functions such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt.


  Details of the scrypt key derivation function are given in a paper by

  Colin Percival, Stronger Key Derivation via Sequential Memory-Hard

  Functions: <http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf>.'

description: ! 'Scion is a Haskell library that aims to implement those parts of a

  Haskell IDE which are independent of a particular front-end.  Scion

  is based on the GHC API and Cabal.  It provides both a Haskell API and

  a server for non-Haskell clients such as Emacs and Vim.


  See the homepage <http://code.google.com/p/scion-lib> and the README

  <http://github.com/nominolo/scion/blob/master/README.markdown> for

  more information.'

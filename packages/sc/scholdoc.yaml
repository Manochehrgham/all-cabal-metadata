description: ! 'Scholdoc is a command-line utility that converts

  ScholarlyMarkdown documents into the HTML5, LaTeX, and Docx

  (OOML) formats. It is intended to facilitate academic writing

  in a cross-platform, semantic-aware, plaintext format that can

  be quickly used in modern publishing pipelines.


  Scholdoc is implemented as (rather crude) fork of @pandoc@,

  and the command-line executable mostly retains the same user

  interface (including the custom template and filter system).

  It essentially understands a new input format

  @markdown_scholarly@ (implemented in the markdown reader a

  superset of @markdown_pandoc@ features), and limits itself to

  HTML5, LaTeX, and Docx output.


  Unfortunately, currently Scholdoc occupies the @Pandoc@

  namespace. This is done to avoid problems when merging in

  fixes and changes from the core Pandoc project, and to

  potentially allow enhancements from Scholdoc to be contributed

  back to Pandoc. It is thus not recommended to use the library

  directly, as Scholdoc is not backwards-compatible with Pandoc,

  to avoid confusion.

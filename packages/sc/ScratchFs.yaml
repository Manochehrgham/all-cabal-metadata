description: ! 'ScratchFS is a FUSE-based filesystem which provides a size-limited
  directory tree.

  When the filesystem is mounted, the user provides a maximum size the target directory
  and all it''s

  subdirectories may get. All IO operations in the mountdirectory are tracked and
  the oldest files in the watchdirectory get deleted automatically.'

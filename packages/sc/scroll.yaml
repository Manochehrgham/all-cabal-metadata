  release that does not change any gameplay.\n  * Support use as a pager, with input
  piped in on stdin, as long\n    as the unix module is available.\n  * Rename Setup.hs
  since cabal uses that name.\n    Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich of Gentoo, which has
  packaged scroll!\n  * Don't crash on exceedingly small input files when being used
  as a\n    pager.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sat, 14 Mar 2015 15:32:28 -0400\n\nscroll

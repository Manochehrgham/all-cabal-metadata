synopsis: scroll(6), a roguelike game
changelog: ! "scroll (1.20150323) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * Fix a minor bug
  when moving over punctuation that was not swallowed.\n    (This didn't affect gameplay.)\n\n
  -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Mon, 23 Mar 2015 10:43:55 -0400\n\nscroll (1.20150314)
  unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  * This is a post-7drl release that does not change
  any gameplay.\n  * Support use as a pager, with input piped in on stdin, as long\n
  \   as the unix module is available.\n  * Rename Setup.hs since cabal uses that
  name.\n    Thanks to Sergei Trofimovich of Gentoo, which has packaged scroll!\n
  \ * Don't crash on exceedingly small input files when being used as a\n    pager.\n\n

  unstable; urgency=low\n\n  * First release, at the end of 7DRL 2015!\n  * Thanks
  to all my playtesters, and to the 7DRL community.\n\n -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>

description: ! 'P2P VPN implementation currently without any encryption.

  Supports Windows and Unix variants. Features include:


  * Simple NAT Traversal using UDP (similar to STUN, not the same).


  * Automatic address assignment to new peers


  * Emulates a LAN between machines


  Note: Scurry currently has no encryption layer or authentication

  mechanism at all. Also, the packet switching is currently

  implemented using Data.List.lookup as opposed to something

  more appropriate. This really isn''t much of a problem until

  you hit hundreds or thousands of peers.


  Requires a TAP-Win32 driver to run in Windows. Requires the tun

  module to be loaded to run in Linux (expects \/dev\/net\/tun).'

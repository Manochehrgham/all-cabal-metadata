description: ! 'This package is a fork of @pandoc-types@ intended to

  support the development of Scholdoc. It includes some

  non-trivial extensions to the Pandoc types and builder

  functions that are not easily implemented by depending on

  and extending the @pandoc-types@ modules.


  This package is currently up to date with @pandoc-types@

  version 1.12.4

description: ! 'This package is a fork of @texmath@, intended to support

  the development of Scholdoc. It is currently just a

  trivial fork just so it can compile against

  @scholdoc-types@ without polluting the @texmath@ package

  namespace.


  This package is currently up to date with @taxmath@

  version 0.8.0.1


  The @texmath@ library provides functions to read and write

  TeX math, presentation MathML, and OMML (Office Math

  Markup Language, used in Microsoft Office). For

  descriptions of the original @texmath@ package, please

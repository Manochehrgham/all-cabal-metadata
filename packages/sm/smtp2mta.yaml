description: ! 'This is a simple SMTP server that forwards all mail to a

  sendmail-compatible script.


  The primary intended use is to allow broken MUAs that expect to always

  send over SMTP to send with a standard MTA script.  (This allows one

  to authenticate with a mailserver using SSH keys, for example.)


  smtp2mta can be run as a standalone server, or can serve connections

  from behind inetd.'

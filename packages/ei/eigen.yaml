description: ! 'This module provides Haskell binding for Eigen C++ library.

  Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical
  solvers, and related algorithms.

  Eigen home page is <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/>.


  Eigen is licensed under the MPL2, which is a simple weak copyleft license. Common
  questions about the MPL2 are answered in the official MPL2 FAQ at <http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/FAQ.html>.


  Note that currently, a few features in Eigen rely on third-party code licensed under
  the LGPL: SimplicialCholesky, AMD ordering, and constrained_cg. Such features are
  explicitly disabled by compiling Eigen with the EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY preprocessor symbol
  defined.


  Virtually any software may use Eigen. For example, closed-source software may use
  Eigen without having to disclose its own source code. Many proprietary and closed-source
  software projects are using Eigen right now, as well as many BSD-licensed projects.


  Some parts of documentation strings are based or replicate original Eigen documentation
  which is available at <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/>.'

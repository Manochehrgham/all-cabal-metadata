description: ! 'Intel (Concurrent Collections) CnC is a data-flow like

  deterministic parallel programming model, similar to

  stream-processing but in which nodes in the computation graph share data in tables.

  In CnC, the structure of the graph and metadata about data-access

  patterns are stored in a specification, which can be used by this

  tool to generate code which will orchestrate the execution of the graph.'

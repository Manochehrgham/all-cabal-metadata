description: ! 'The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Storm Water

  Management Model (SWMM) is a dynamic hydrology-hydraulic water

  quality simulation model for single event or long-term (continuous)

  simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas.

  SWMM 5, which is currently the newest version of SWMM, produces a

  binary .OUT file as its output.  SWMMoutGetMB is a SWMM binary

  reader using the Get monad in Haskell to retrieve contents of this

  binary file and save it into a SWMMObject, which can then be

  used in Haskell programs.'

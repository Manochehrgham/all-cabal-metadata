description: ! 'Online Gibbs sampler for Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

  LDA is a generative admixture model frequently used

  for topic modeling and other applications. The primary

  goal of this implementation is to be used for probabilistic

  soft word class induction.

  The sampler can be used in an online as well as batch mode.

  This package uses an imperative implementation in the ST monad.'

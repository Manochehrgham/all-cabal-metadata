description: ! 'wxHaskell is a portable and native GUI library for Haskell. It is

  built on top of wxWidgets, a comprehensive C++ library that is

  portable across all major GUI platforms, including GTK, Windows,

  X11, and MacOS X. This version works with wxWidgets 2.9 and 3.0.

  Distributed under the WXWINDOWS LIBRARY LICENSE. Please see

  LICENSE file, but note that this is essentially LGPL with an

  exception allowing binary distribution of proprietary software.

  This is the same license as wxWidgets itself uses.'

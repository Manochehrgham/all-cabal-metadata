description: ! 'Using an algebraic data types structure and field names, this library
  constructs

  widgets for wxHaskell. It can handle data types with single or multiple

  constructors, as well as recursive data types.


  The library is designed to integrate smoothly with wxHaskell. First, by making it

  easy to integrate WxGeneric-widgets into existing wxHaskell programs. Second, by

  letting a user extend WxGeneric using mostly wxHaskell function.'

description: ! 'A program to learn how to implement basic text editing functionality
  with wxHaskell.

  It''s not useful itself, the point is to read the code and learn from it ;)

  The program is divided in 6 steps, each one corresponding to a window and a haskell
  module.  Each step includes what was learnt in the previous one, so Step6 is an
  almost complete basic text editor.'

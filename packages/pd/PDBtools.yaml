description: ! 'This is a collection of modules for the analysis of protein

  coordinates. The suite allows efficient computation on a large

  data set of RCSB protein data bank files. Parsing returns both

  protein and ligand coordinates. All of the information in ATOM

  and HETATM records of a PDB file is preserved.'

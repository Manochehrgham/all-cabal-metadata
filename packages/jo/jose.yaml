description: ! '

  An implementation of the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption

  (JOSE) and JSON Web Token (JWT) formats.


  Web Encryption (JWE) is not yet implemented.


  All JWS algorithms (HMAC, ECDSA, RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 and RSASSA-PSS)

  are implemented, however, the ECDSA implementation is is

  vulnerable to timing attacks and should therefore only be used for

  JWS verification.


  The ''Crypto.JOSE.Legacy'' module is provided for working with the

  Mozilla Persona (formerly BrowserID) key format.  Only RSA keys

  are supported - DSA keys cannot be used and must be handled as

  opaque objects.


  The version number tracks the IETF jose working group draft

  revisions.  For now, expect breaking API changes on any version

  change except for the final (fourth) part being incremented.'

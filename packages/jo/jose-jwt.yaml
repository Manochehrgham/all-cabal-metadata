description: ! '

  Intended to provide support for the JOSE suite of IETF (draft)

  standards and the closely related JWT (JSON web token) spec

  (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32/>).


  Both signed and encrypted JWTs are supported, as well as simple

  JWK format keys.


  The library is currently intended to support work on an OpenID

  Connect implementation and the APIs should not be considered

  complete, stable or secure for all use cases.'

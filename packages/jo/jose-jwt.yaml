synopsis: JSON Object Signing and Encryption Library
changelog: ! '0.7

  ---


  * Add support for AES key wrap in JWEs.

  * Support A192GCM and A192CBC-HS384 algorithms.

  * Switch to cryptonite library.


  0.6.2

  -----


  * Remove dependency on `errors` package.


  0.6.1

  -----


  * Minor internal changes to fix build on GHC 7.10.


  0.6

  ---


  * Change KeyId type to allow use of a UTCTime string for the identifier.

  * Internal crypto fixes to prevent exceptions from external libraries.


  0.5

  ---


  * Add JwtEncoding type. Changes API of `Jwt.encode` and `Jwt.decode`.


  0.4.2

  -----


  * Fix in the code for finding suitable JWKs for encoding/decoding.


  0.4.1.1

  -------


  * Added `doctest` flag to cabal file to allow doctests to be disabled.


  0.4.1

  -----


  * Add cprng-aes dependency to doctests to stop test failure on travis and nixos
  hydra builds.


  0.4

  ---


  * Changed use of `Jwt` type to represent an encoded JWT.

  * Introduced `Payload` type to allow setting the `cty` header value correctly for
  nested JWTs.

  * Added an explicit `Unsecured` type for a decoded JWT, to make it obvious when
  the content is not signed or encrypted.

  * Fixed some bugs in JSON encoding and decoding of EC JWKs.


  0.3.1

  -----


  Changed the signature of `Jwt.encode` to take a list of `Jwk` rather than a single
  key. The key will be selected from

  the list based on the specified algorithms.


  0.3

  ---


  * New support for JWS validation using elliptic curve algorithms.

  * Added `Jwt.encode` function which takes a JWK argument, allowing key data (currently
  the key ID) to be encoded in the token header.

description: ! '

  An implementation of the JOSE suite of IETF standards

  and the closely related JWT (JSON web token) spec

  (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519/>).


  Both signed and encrypted JWTs are supported, as well as simple

  JWK keys.'

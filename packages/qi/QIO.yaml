description: The Quantum IO Monad is a library for defining quantum computations in
  Haskell. It can be thought of as an embedded language within Haskell, and comes
  with functions for simulating the running of these quantum computations. The distribution
  contains many example computations written in QIO, including an implementation of
  Shor's algorithm.

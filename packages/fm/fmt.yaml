changelog: ! '# 0.0.0.2


  * Added `>%%<` so that it''d be possible to write `%<a>%%<b>%` instead of weird
  `%<a%<b>%`.


  * Added `%<< ... >>%`, which work work `Show` instead of `Buildable`. If you don''t
  care about speed and just want to output something, use them.


  * Added an `IO ()` instance in `Fmt.IO`. If you import that module, raw formatted
  strings would print themselves.


  * Added tests.


  * Changed fixities of operators so that `%<n+1>%` would work.


  * Changed license to BSD3 since all our dependencies are BSD3 and we can''t use
  MIT.

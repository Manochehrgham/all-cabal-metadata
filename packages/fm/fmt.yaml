synopsis: Nice formatting library
changelog: ! "# 0.0.0.4\n\n* Added `format` from `text-format`, because in some cases
  it's nicer than brackets.\n\n* Renamed `padCenterF` to `padBothF`.\n\n* Modified
  `indent` and `indent'` to always add newlines.\n\n# 0.0.0.3\n\n* Wrote documentation.\n\n*
  Added some formatters:\n\n    * `indent`\n    * formatters for lists, maps and tuples
  (`listF`, etc)\n    * `octF`, `binF`, `baseF` and floating-point formatters\n    *
  `hexF` which works on both numbers and bytestrings\n    * `ordinalF` and `commaizeF`\n
  \   * padding and trimming formatters\n    * `base64F` and `base64UrlF`\n    * conditionals
  (`whenF` and `unlessF`)\n\n* Merged `Fmt.IO` with `Fmt` because orphan instances
  are controversial.\n\n* Exported internal classes and functions from `Fmt.Internal`.\n\n*
  Added `fmt` and `fmtLn`.\n\n* Made all operators associate to the right (`Builder`
  documentation says it's faster than the opposite).\n\n* Reexported `Buildable` and
  `Builder`.\n\n# 0.0.0.2\n\n* Added `>%%<` so that it'd be possible to write `%<a>%%<b>%`
  instead of weird `%<a%<b>%`.\n\n* Added `%<< ... >>%`, which work work `Show` instead
  of `Buildable`. If you don't care about speed and just want to output something,
  use them.\n\n* Added an `IO ()` instance in `Fmt.IO`. If you import that module,
  raw formatted strings would print themselves.\n\n* Added tests.\n\n* Changed fixities
  of operators so that `%<n+1>%` would work.\n\n* Changed license to BSD3 since all
  our dependencies are BSD3 and we can't use MIT.\n\n# 0.0.0.1\n\nFirst (completely
  experimental) release.\n"

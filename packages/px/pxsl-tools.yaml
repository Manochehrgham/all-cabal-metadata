description: ! 'The package contains the pxslcc compiler, which converts

  Parsimonious XML Shorthand Language (PXSL) into XML.  PXSL ("pixel")

  is a convenient shorthand for writing markup-heavy XML documents.

  It provides XML authors and programmers with a simple, concise

  syntax that they can use to create XML documents. For more advanced

  users, PXSL offers customizable shortcuts and sophisticated

  refactoring tools like functional macros that can markedly reduce

  the size and complexity of markup-dense XML documents.'

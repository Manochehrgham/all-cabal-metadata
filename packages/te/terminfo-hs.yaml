description: ! 'This module can acquire terminfo databases and query

  them for terminal capabilities. For details of

  terminfo, consult the man pages for term(5) and

  terminfo(5).

  This package is dead simple, and doesn''t do anything

  fancy with the capabilities themselves. It merely

  provides a means for accessing them.'

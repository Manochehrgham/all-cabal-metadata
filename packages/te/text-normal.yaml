description: ! 'This package provides types and functions for normalizing and comparing

  @Text@ values according to Unicode equivalence.


  An in-depth explanation of the forms of Unicode equivalence can be found

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence on Wikipedia>.


  The modules in this package are named and function according to the four methods
  of

  Unicode normalization. The @Normal@ types exported by each are purposefully

  not compatible with functions exported by the other modules.


  This package depends on @text-icu@, which means it requires that the @icu@

  C library is installed.'

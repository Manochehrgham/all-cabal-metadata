description: ! 'The @text@ package provides high performance functions for decoding
  strict and lazy @ByteString@s into @Text@. However, these functions present two
  issues for streaming data libraries: they throw exceptions from pure code, and are
  not designed for incremental consumption. This library addresses both issues with
  a unified API for UTF-8, -16LE, -16BE, -32LE, and -32BE. It is intended for use
  by high level streaming data libraries, such as conduit, enumerator, iteratee, and
  pipes.'

description: ! 'TemplatePG provides PostgreSQL access from Haskell via the

  PostgreSQL protocol. It also provides a higher-level Template

  Haskell interface. It eliminates a class of runtime errors by

  checking queries against a PostgreSQL database at compile-time.

  This also reduces boilerplate code for dealing with query

  results, as the type and number of result columns are known at

  compile-time.'

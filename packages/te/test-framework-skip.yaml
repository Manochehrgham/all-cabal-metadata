description: ! 'When tracking down a problem it can often be useful to temporarily
  disable

  some or many of the tests in a suite so that one can focus on the problematic

  tests.  Rather than using a mess of comments, this module provides a

  function ''skip'' (and a few variants) that causses a test or an entire test

  suite to be skipped - specifically, they will still show up in the suite

  as being ''skipped'', but they will not be run.'

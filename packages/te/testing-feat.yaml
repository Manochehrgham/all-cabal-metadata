description: ! 'Feat (Functional Enumeration of Algebraic Types) provides

  enumerations as functions from natural numbers to values

  (similar to @toEnum@ but for any algebraic data type). This

  can be used for SmallCheck-style systematic testing,

  QuickCheck style random testing, and hybrids of the two.


  The enumerators are defined in a very boilerplate manner

  and there is a Template Haskell script for deriving the

  class instance for most types.

  "Test.Feat" contain a subset of the other modules that

  should be sufficient for most test usage. There

  are some small and large example in the tar

  ball. Builds with haskell-platform-2012-2.0.0 and with ghc-7.6.1.'

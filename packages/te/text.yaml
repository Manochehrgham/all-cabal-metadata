synopsis: An efficient packed Unicode text type.
changelog: ! "1.2.0.5\n\n* Feature parity: repeat, cycle, iterate are now implemented
  for lazy\n  Text, and the Data instance is more complete\n\n* Build speed: an inliner
  space explosion has been fixed with toCaseFold\n\n* Bug fix: encoding Int to a Builder
  would infinite-loop if the\n  integer-simple package was used\n\n* Deprecation:
  OnEncodeError and EncodeError are deprecated, as they\n  are never used\n\n* Internals:
  some types that are used internally in fusion-related\n  functions have moved around,
  been renamed, or been deleted (we don't\n  bump the major version if .Internal modules
  change)\n\n* Spec compliance: toCaseFold now follows the Unicode 7.0 spec\n  (updated
  from 6.3)\n\n1.2.0.4\n\n* Fixed an incompatibility with base < 4.5\n\n1.2.0.3\n\n*
  Update formatRealFloat to correspond to the definition in versions\n  of base newer
  than 4.5 (https://github.com/bos/text/issues/105)\n\n1.2.0.2\n\n* Bumped lower bound
  on deepseq to 1.4 for compatibility with the\n  upcoming GHC 7.10\n\n1.2.0.1\n\n*
  Fixed a buffer overflow in rendering of large Integers\n  (https://github.com/bos/text/issues/99)\n\n1.2.0.0\n\n*
  Fixed an integer overflow in the replace function\n  (https://github.com/bos/text/issues/81)\n\n*
  Fixed a hang in lazy decodeUtf8With\n  (https://github.com/bos/text/issues/87)\n\n*
  Reduced codegen bloat caused by use of empty and single-character\n  literals\n\n*
  Added an instance of IsList for GHC 7.8 and above\n\n1.1.1.0\n\n* The Data.Data
  instance now allows gunfold to work, via a virtual\n  pack constructor\n\n* dropEnd,
  takeEnd: new functions\n\n* Comparing the length of a Text against a number can
  now\n  short-circuit in more cases\n\n1.1.0.1\n\n* streamDecodeUtf8: fixed gh-70,
  did not return all unconsumed bytes\n  in single-byte chunks\n\n1.1.0.0\n\n* encodeUtf8:
  Performance is improved by up to 4x.\n\n* encodeUtf8Builder, encodeUtf8BuilderEscaped:
  new functions,\n  available only if bytestring >= 0.10.4.0 is installed, that allow\n
  \ very fast and flexible encoding of a Text value to a bytestring\n  Builder.\n\n
  \ As an example of the performance gain to be had, the\n  encodeUtf8BuilderEscaped
  function helps to double the speed of JSON\n  encoding in the latest version of
  aeson! (Note: if all you need is a\n  plain ByteString, encodeUtf8 is still the
  faster way to go.)\n\n* All of the internal module hierarchy is now publicly exposed.
  \ If a\n  module is in the .Internal hierarchy, or is documented as internal,\n
  \ use at your own risk - there are no API stability guarantees for\n  internal modules!\n\n1.0.0.1\n\n*
  decodeUtf8: Fixed a regression that caused us to incorrectly\n  identify truncated
  UTF-8 as valid (gh-61)\n\n1.0.0.0\n\n* Added support for Unicode 6.3.0 to case conversion
  functions\n\n* New function toTitle converts words in a string to title case\n\n*
  New functions peekCStringLen and withCStringLen simplify\n  interoperability with
  C functionns\n\n* Added support for decoding UTF-8 in stream-friendly fashion\n\n*
  Fixed a bug in mapAccumL\n\n* Added trusted Haskell support\n\n* Removed support
  for GHC 6.10 (released in 2008) and older\n"

description: ! '# Text: Fast, packed Unicode strings, using stream fusion


  This package provides the Data.Text library, a library for the space-

  and time-efficient manipulation of Unicode text in Haskell.



  # Normalization, conversion, and collation, oh my!


  This library intentionally provides a simple API based on the

  Haskell prelude''s list manipulation functions.  For more complicated

  real-world tasks, such as Unicode normalization, conversion to and

  from a larger variety of encodings, and collation, use the [text-icu

  package](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/text-icu).


  That library uses the well-respected and liberally licensed ICU

  library to provide these facilities.

  Please report bugs via the

  [github issue tracker](https://github.com/bos/text/issues).


  Master [git repository](https://github.com/bos/text):


  * `git clone git://github.com/bos/text.git`


  There''s also a [Mercurial mirror](https://bitbucket.org/bos/text):


  * `hg clone https://bitbucket.org/bos/text`


  (You can create and contribute changes using either Mercurial or git.)



  # Authors


  The base code for this library was originally written by Tom Harper,

  based on the stream fusion framework developed by Roman Leshchinskiy,

  Duncan Coutts, and Don Stewart.


  The core library was fleshed out, debugged, and tested by Bryan

  O''Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>, and he is the current maintainer.

description: ! 'Manipulate identifiers and structurally non-complex pieces

  of text by delimiting word boundaries via a combination of whitespace,

  control-characters, and case-sensitivity.


  Has support for common idioms like casing of programmatic variable names,

  taking, dropping, and splitting by word, and modifying the first character

  of a piece of text.


  /Caution:/ this library makes heavy use of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text
  text>

  library''s internal loop optimisation framework. Since internal modules are not

  guaranteed to have a stable API there is potential for build breakage when

  the text dependency is upgraded. Consider yourself warned!'

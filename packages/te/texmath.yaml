description: ! 'The texmath library provides functions to read and

  write TeX math, presentation MathML, and OMML (Office

  Math Markup Language, used in Microsoft Office).

  Support is also included for converting math formats

  to pandoc''s native format (allowing conversion, via

  pandoc, to a variety of different markup formats).

  The TeX reader supports basic LaTeX and AMS extensions,

  and it can parse and apply LaTeX macros.

  (See <http://johnmacfarlane.net/texmath here> for a live

  demo of bidirectional conversion between LaTeX

  and MathML.)


  The package also includes several utility modules which

  may be useful for anyone looking to manipulate either

  TeX math or MathML.  For example, a copy of the MathML

  operator dictionary is included.


  Use the @executable@ flag to install a standalone

  executable, @texmath@, that by default reads a LaTeX

  formula from @stdin@ and writes MathML to @stdout@.

  With flags all the functionality exposed by

  ''Text.TeXMath'' can be accessed through this executable.

  (Use the @--help@ flag for a description of all

  functionality)


  The @texmath@ executable can also be used as a CGI

  script, when renamed as @texmath-cgi@.

  It will expect query parameters for @from@, @to@,

  @input@, and optionally @inline@, and return a JSON

  object with either @error@ and a message or

  @success@ and the converted result.'

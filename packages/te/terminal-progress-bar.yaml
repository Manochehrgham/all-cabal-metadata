description: ! 'A progress bar is used to convey the progress of a task. This

  package implements a very simple textual progress bar.


  See the module ''System.ProgressBar'' on how to use the progress bar

  or build the package with the -fexample flag for a small example

  program.


  The animated progress bar depends entirely on the interpretation of

  the carriage return character (\''\\r\''). If your terminal interprets

  it as something else then \"move cursor to beginning of line\", the

  animation won''t work.


  Note: Due to a bug in \"cabal haddock\" you will have to manually

  uncomment the example section in the cabal file. But uncommenting

  that section will result in \"cabal haddock\" failing.'

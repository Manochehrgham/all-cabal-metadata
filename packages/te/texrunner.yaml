description: ! 'texrunner is an interface to tex that attempts to parse errors and

  can parse tex in online mode to retrive hbox sizes.


  This package should be considered very experimental. Eventually I hope

  it will be good enough for general use but for now it''s only suitable

  for simple things.'

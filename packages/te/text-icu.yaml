description: ! 'Haskell bindings to the International Components for Unicode (ICU)

  libraries.  These libraries provide robust and full-featured Unicode

  services on a wide variety of platforms.


  Features include:


  * Both pure and impure bindings, to allow for fine control over efficiency

  and ease of use.


  * Breaking of strings on character, word, sentence, and line boundaries.


  * Access to the Unicode Character Database (UCD) of character metadata.


  * String collation functions, for locales where the conventions for

  lexicographic ordering differ from the simple numeric ordering of

  character codes.


  * Character set conversion functions, allowing conversion between

  Unicode and over 220 character encodings.


  * Unicode normalization.  (When implementations keep strings in a

  normalized form, they can be assured that equivalent strings have a

  unique binary representation.)


  * Regular expression search and replace.'

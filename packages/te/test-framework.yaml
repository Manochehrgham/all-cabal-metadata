description: ! 'Allows tests such as QuickCheck properties and HUnit test cases to
  be assembled into test groups, run in

  parallel (but reported in deterministic order, to aid diff interpretation) and filtered
  and controlled by

  command line options. All of this comes with colored test output, progress reporting
  and test statistics output.'

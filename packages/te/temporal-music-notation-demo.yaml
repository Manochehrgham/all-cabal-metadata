description: ! 'Library for playing scores made with ''temporal-music-notation''

  via midi. It binds ''temporal-media-notation'' and ''HCodecs''

  packages. Features composable score representation and

  microsound composition. It relies on

  Midi Tuning Standart (MTS) so it''s better to listen results

  with TiMidity or another soft that undestands MTS.

  Examples can be found source directory.'

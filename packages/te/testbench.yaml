description: ! 'Test your benchmarks!  Benchmark your tests!


  It''s too easy to accidentally try and benchmark apples and oranges

  together.  Wouldn''t it be nice if you could somehow guarantee that

  your benchmarks satisfy some simple tests (e.g. a group of comparisons

  all return the same value)?


  Furthermore, trying to compare multiple inputs/functions against each

  other requires a lot of boilerplate, making it even easier to

  accidentally compare the wrong things (e.g. using `whnf` instead of

  `nf`).


  /testbench/ aims to help solve these problems and more by making it

  easier to write unit tests and benchmarks together by stating up-front

  what requirements are needed and then using simple functions to state

  the next parameter to be tested/benchmarked.'

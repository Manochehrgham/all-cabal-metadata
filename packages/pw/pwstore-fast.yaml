description: ! 'To store passwords securely, they should be salted,

  then hashed with a slow hash function. This library

  uses PBKDF1-SHA256, and handles all the details.

  It uses the cryptohash package for speed; if you need

  a pure Haskell library, pwstore-purehaskell has the

  exact same API, but uses only pure Haskell. It is

  about 25 times slower than this package, but still

  quite usable.'

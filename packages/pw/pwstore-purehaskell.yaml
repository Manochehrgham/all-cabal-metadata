description: ! 'To store passwords securely, they should be salted,

  then hashed with a slow hash function. This library

  uses PBKDF1-SHA256, and handles all the details.

  It is implemented in pure Haskell, with no C

  dependencies. For a faster implementation, the

  pwstore-fast package has the exact same API but is

  about 25 times faster due to its use of the cryptohash

  package, which is partly implemented in C. This pure

  Haskell version is visibly slower, but still quite usable.'

description: ! "Version 1.1.5 of the Qt bindings for Haskell, a set of Haskell bindings
  for the\r\nQt library from Trolltech.  There are no subtantial changes to the code,
  but it\r\nnow compiles with GHC 7.6 (and possibly with newer versions of GHC).\r\n\r\nThere
  was a bug related to the Foreign Function Interface. In most cases that\r\ncould
  be resolved by importing Foreign.C.Types, but not always.  I introduced a\r\ncouple
  of extra changes to make things compile, but there is no guarantee that\r\nthey
  will work. Actually, I would expect them to break. Please, try them, and\r\nif you
  can find a better solution, send a msg or a pull request.\r\n\r\nHtml Documentation
  for this project can be found in the 'doc' folder.\r\nThe qtHaskell User Guide includes
  comprehensive installation instructions.\r\nSee examples/ and demos/ for code examples.\r\n\r\nNote:
  I had to modify the scripts to make it work with cabal sandboxes and to\r\ninstall
  files in a local directory and not /usr/local/. It's not portable, just\r\ncustomised.
  Let me know if you want to have access to that build.pl script.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRegarding
  the old version:\r\n\r\nThe original version of this library used to be hosted here:\r\nhttp://qthaskell.berlios.de\r\nThat
  website no longer exists.\r\n"

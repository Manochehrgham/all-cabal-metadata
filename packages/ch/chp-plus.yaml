description: ! 'In version 1.0.0, this package contains functionality split

  off during the chp 1.x to 2.0 transition.  In future, it will

  contain any new CHP features that build on the core library,

  and that do not require access to CHP''s internals.  This

  package is closely tied to the chp package.'

description: ! 'Chalkboard is a Haskell hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for
  image generation and processing.

  The basic structure is a chalk board, a two-dimensional canvas of values, typically
  colors.

  Chalkboard provides the usual image processing functions (masking, overlaying, function
  mapping,

  cropping, warping, rotating) as well as a few more unusual ones.


  Chalkboard Viewer is a portal into a dynamically updatable Board, via an OpenGL
  window.'

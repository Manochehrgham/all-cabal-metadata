description: ! 'This is an experimental Markdown processor in pure

  Haskell.  It aims to process Markdown efficiently and in

  the most forgiving possible way.  It is designed to deal

  with any input, including garbage, with linear

  performance.  Output is sanitized by default for

  protection against XSS attacks.


  Several markdown extensions are implemented, including

  fenced code blocks, significant list start numbers, and

  autolinked URLs.  See README.markdown for details.'

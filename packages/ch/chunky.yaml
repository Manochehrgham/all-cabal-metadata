description: ! 'Allows serializing data into binary files, preserving human readability

  as far as possible. It allows mixing binary and textual data in the same file, and

  is a light-weight alternative to parsec & co. The generated files are not intended

  to be human-editable, only readable.

  If the stored binary data is utf8-encoded text, the whole file can be read in any

  text-editor.'

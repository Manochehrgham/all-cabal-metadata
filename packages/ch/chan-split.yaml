description: ! 'An implementation of concurrent channels identical to

  Control.Concurrent.Chan, except that the channel is

  represented as a pair, one of which allows only read

  operations, the other write operations.


  This makes code easier to reason about (the types strictly

  delegate read/write permission), suggests useful instances

  (e.g.  ''Functor'' and ''Contravariant'' are easily defined)

  on the chan pairs, and simplifies the API.


  Furthermore this allows messages sent to channels with no

  readers to be trivially garbage-collected, without relying

  on inlining optimizations.


  We also provide a module that defines a class ''SplitChan''

  which defines the basic methods any pair of Chan types

  should provide, allowing easy swapping of Chan

  implementations.


  To use standard Chans with these polymorphic functions,

  import as follows:


  > import Control.Concurrent.Chan hiding (readChan,writeChan,writeList2Chan)

  > import Control.Concurrent.Chan.Class


  When used alongside standard Chans, the Split module can be

  imported qualified like:


  > import qualified Control.Concurrent.Chan.Split as S


  Its interface is mostly backwards compatible with Chan.

  Note, we do not implement the deprecated unGetChan and

  isEmptyChan functions.


  This module is used internally by the "simple-actors" package.


  /CHANGES/: 0.4.0 -> 0.5.0

  - depend on STM


  - clean up Extensions section and broken links

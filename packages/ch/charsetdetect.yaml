description: ! 'Mozilla have developed a robust and efficient character set detection
  algorithm for

  use in their web browsers.  The algorithm is able to detect all of the most frequently

  encountered character encodings totally automatically.


  This library wraps up their library and exposes a very simple Haskell interface
  to it.

  The library is portable, and is confirmed to work on both Unix and Windows.'

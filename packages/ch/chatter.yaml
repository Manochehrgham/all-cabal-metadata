description: ! 'chatter is a collection of simple Natural Language

  Processing algorithms.


  Chatter supports:


  * Part of speech tagging with Averaged

  Perceptrons. Based on the Python implementation

  by Matthew Honnibal:

  (<http://honnibal.wordpress.com/2013/09/11/a-good-part-of-speechpos-tagger-in-about-200-lines-of-python/>)
  See ''NLP.POS'' for the details of part-of-speech tagging with chatter.


  * Phrasal Chunking (also with an Averaged Perceptron) to identify arbitrary chunks
  based on training data.


  * Document similarity; A cosine-based similarity measure, and TF-IDF calculations,

  are available in the ''NLP.Similarity.VectorSim'' module.


  * Information Extraction patterns via (<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec/>)
  Parsec


  Chatter comes with models for POS tagging and

  Phrasal Chunking that have been trained on the

  Brown corpus (POS only) and the Conll2000 corpus

  (POS and Chunking)'

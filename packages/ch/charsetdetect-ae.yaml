description: ! 'Mozilla have developed a robust and efficient character set detection
  algorithm for use in their web browsers. The algorithm is able to detect all of
  the most frequently encountered character encodings totally automatically.


  This library wraps up their library and exposes a very simple Haskell interface
  to it. The library is portable, and is confirmed to work on both Unix and Windows.


  This library is a /maintained/ fork of charsetdetect:


  * It compiles with recent version of bytestring.


  * It works correctly in presence of Template Haskell on GHC 7.6.


  * It builds on 64-bit Windows.'

description: ! 'The Communicating Haskell Processes (CHP) library is an

  implementation of message-passing concurrency ideas from

  Hoare''s Communicating Sequential Processes.  More details and

  a tutorial can be found at its homepage:

  <http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/ofa/chp/>, and there is

  also now a blog with examples of using the library:

  <http://chplib.wordpress.com/>.  The library requires at

  least GHC 6.8.1.  NOTE: since version 2.0.0, some capabilities

  that were present in version 1.x have been moved out to the

  chp-plus package.'

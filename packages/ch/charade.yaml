description: ! 'Charade is a tool for rapid website prototyping using Heist and Snap.

  Charade-generated sites can easily be dropped into Snap applications

  and work out of the box with no modification.


  The main thing provided by this package is the charade executable that

  serves your prototype sites.  The library provided contains a Heist splice

  that you use to make all evidence of charade disappear in your production

  app.

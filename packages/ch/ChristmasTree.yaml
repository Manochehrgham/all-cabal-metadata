description: ChristmasTree (Changing Haskell's Read Implementation Such That by Mainpulating
  ASTs it Reads Expressions Efficiently) is an alternative approach of 'read' that
  composes grammars instead of parsers. It reads data in linear time, while the function
  'read' has an exponential behavior in some cases of data types with infix operators.

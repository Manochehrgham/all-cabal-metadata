description: ! 'Shell command that finds files with equal content in a given set of
  files.

  This is useful for finding duplicates in a set of documents

  where the same document might have been stored by accident with different names.

  Use it like


  > equal-files `find my_dir -type f`


  or


  > find my_dir -type f | xargs equal-files


  If the file names contain spaces, better use


  > find my_dir -type f -printf "''%p''\n" | xargs equal-files


  or


  > equal_files -r my_dir


  The program reads all input files simultaneously,

  driven by sorting and grouping of their content.

  However be prepared that due to the simultaneous access

  you may exceed the admissible number of opened files.

  Thus you may prefer to run it like


  > equal_files -r -p 512 my_dir


  The program can be used as a nice example of a declarative

  yet efficient implementation of a non-trivial algorithm,

  that is enabled by lazy evaluation.'

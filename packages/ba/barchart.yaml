description: ! 'This package provides a program that generates bar charts from CSV

  files and has special support for visualising the benchmark results

  of the criterion and progression tools. It comes with an associated

  API that can be used to generate custom bar charts in case the

  charts generated by the command-line program are insufficient for

  your needs.'

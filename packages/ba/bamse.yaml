description: ! 'Bamse is a framework for building Windows Installers for

  your Windows applications, giving you a comprehensive set

  of features to put together MSIs using Haskell.


  Bamse lets you author /installer generators/, i.e., applications

  that will generate Windows Installers when invoked (and pointed

  at the files and other resources to include for that particular

  installer instance.) Bamse is also accessible as a library, letting

  you integrate MSI creation into your codebase.


  The package has a number of example /templates/ showing how to

  specify a generator; /real/ examples that have been used to ship

  software by a number of projects and companies. See the @templates/@

  directory; one good way to get started is to modify one of these

  to suit the needs of the installers you are looking to create.


  For a worked example of how to build installers from your Cabal packages,

  and possibly automatically install them when running the MSI, see @examples/Cabal.hs@

  (and the README in that directory.)'

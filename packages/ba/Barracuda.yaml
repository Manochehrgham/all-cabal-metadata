description: ! 'An ad-hoc chat program developed in the software development

  course at the TU-Braunschweig. Barracuda (by Stephan Friedrichs,

  Henning GÃ¼nther, Oliver Mielentz and Martin Wegner) implements an

  ad-hoc (p2p) network. On top of that, a chat application has been realised.


  Just like in IRC, the communication is organised in channels. A channel may be

  anonymous (the messages'' origin is obscured), private (encrypted, only invited

  users may join them) or public (free for all users).


  The design is elaborated in a series of RFCs (see for example

  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-strauss-p2p-chat>).

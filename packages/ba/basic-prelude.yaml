description: ! 'basic-prelude

  =============


  The premise of `basic-prelude` is that there are a lot of very commonly desired

  features missing from the standard `Prelude`, such as commonly used operators

  (`<$>` and `>=>`, for instance) and imports for common datatypes (e.g.,

  `ByteString` and `Vector`). At the same time, there are lots of other

  components which are more debatable, such as providing polymorphic versions of

  common functions.


  So `basic-prelude` is intended to give a common foundation for a number of

  alternate preludes. The package provides two modules: `CorePrelude` provides

  the common ground for other preludes to build on top of, while `BasicPrelude`

  exports `CorePrelude` together with commonly used list functions to provide a

  drop-in replacement for the standard `Prelude`.


  Users wishing to have an improved `Prelude` can use `BasicPrelude`. Developers

  wishing to create a new prelude should use `CorePrelude`.

description: ! 'This package defines new symbols for a number of functions,

  operators and types in the base package.


  All symbols are documented with their actual definition and

  information regarding their Unicode code point. They should be

  completely interchangeable with their definitions.


  For further Unicode goodness you can enable the @UnicodeSyntax@

  language extension \[1\]. This extension enables Unicode characters

  to be used to stand for certain ASCII character sequences,

  i.e. &#x2192; instead of @->@, &#x2200; instead of @forall@ and many

  others.


  Original idea by P&#xE9;ter Divi&#xE1;nszky.

description: ! 'Bake is a continuous integration server, designed for large, productive,
  semi-trusted teams.


  * /Large teams/ where there are at least several contributors working full-time
  on a single code base.


  * /Productive teams/ which are regularly pushing code, many times a day.


  * /Semi-trusted teams/ where code does not go through manual code review, but code
  does need to pass a test suite and perhaps some static analysis. People are assumed
  not to be malicious, but are fallible.'

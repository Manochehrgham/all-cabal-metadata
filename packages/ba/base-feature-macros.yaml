description: ! 'This provides a set of feature macros describing features of @base@
  in a semantic way.


  See <base-feature-macros/src/base-feature-macros.h base-feature-macros.h> for set
  of currently provided macros.


  In order to use the CPP header provided by this package, add this package as a dependency
  to your @.cabal@ file, i.e.


  > build-depends: base-feature-macros: >= 0.1 && < 0.2


  while making sure that the version specified as lower bound defines the feature-macros
  your code tests for. This is particularly important as CPP will implicitly treat
  undefined CPP macros as having the value @0@. See also GNU CPP/CC''s @-Wundef@ warning
  to detect such errors.


  Then in your code, you can include and use the @\<base-feature-macros.h\>@ header
  like so


  > module M where

  >

  > #include <base-feature-macros.h>

  >

  > #if !HAVE_FOLDABLE_TRAVERSABLE_IN_PRELUDE

  > import Data.Foldable (Foldable (..))

  > import Prelude       hiding (foldr, foldr1)

  > #endif

  > #if !HAVE_MONOID_IN_PRELUDE

  > import Data.Monoid hiding ((<>))

  > #endif


  This package is inspired by the blogpost

  macros mean something â€“ readable backwards compatibility with CPP">.'

description: ! 'Barley is an environment for tinkering with Haskell.  It is a web

  server with an embedded simple programming environment rendered as

  web pages.  The environment allows you to easily edit Haskell code

  and quickly see the result of running it.

  Barley includes a tutorial aimed at people with some programming

  and web experience, but it assumes no exposure to Haskell or

  functional programming.  The tutorial takes the developer from

  generating a simple web page through a modest web application with

  database backend storage.  Along the way it exposes the programmer

  to the basic idioms needed to do simple programming tasks.'

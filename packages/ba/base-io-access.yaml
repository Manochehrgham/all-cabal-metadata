description: ! 'An attempt to break up the monolithic IO monad into small, composable
  classes

  that can be used to restrict a function to only having access to, say, functions

  to work with the standard pipes, or a function that can access the environment.

  The motivation for this library is to allow people to make a stricter contract

  than simply "this function does IO", and express through the type system exactly

  what IO is being performed.'

description: It checks for a plugin tag in html and generate a photo album with thumbnails
  in place, by some internal IO options. The current version makes some assumptions
  on where the photo should be stored, so it's mostly useful for bamboo. A download
  of appropriate javascript is required, e.g. innerfade.js.

description: ! 'Provides a simple (but efficient) implementation of the k-means clustering
  algorithm. The goal of this algorithm is to, given a set of n-dimensional points,
  regroup them in k groups, such that each point gets to be in the group to which
  it is the closest to (using the ''center'' of the group).


  CHANGELOG


  0.3: total rewrite of the code, the code scales much better on big inputs and is
  overall

  consistently faster than the other kmeans implementations on hackage, on my laptop.

  0.2: supports having feature vectors associated to objects, and thus computing kmeans
  on these vectors, letting you recover the initial objects.'

description: ! 'Roundtrip allows the definition of bidirectional

  (de-)serialization specifications. The specification language

  is based on the ideas described in the paper

  /Invertible Syntax Descriptions: Unifying Parsing and Pretty Printing/

  by Tillmann Rendel and Klaus Ostermann, Haskell Symposium 2010.


  This package does not provide concrete instances of the

  specification classes, see the packages roundtrip-string and

  roundtrip-xml instead.


  The package contains slightly modified code from

  Tillmann Rendel''s partial-isomorphisms and invertible-syntax

  packages (Copyright (c) 2010-11 University of Marburg).'

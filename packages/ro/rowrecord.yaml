description: ! 'Given rows of @String@ data with column headings, this library will
  create

  values of user-defined record types.  Records can contain mandatory or

  optional fields of any type, subject to a class constraint.

  Heading names and and record construction code are derived using

  Template Haskell.


  One use case for this library is parsing records from a CSV file.  A

  parser from CSV to @[[String]]@ is not included, but there are several

  suitable packages on Hackage.


  The emphasis of this library is on simplicity of use rather than performance.

  It is likely to be suitable for a hundred thousand rows, but not many

  millions.  A future version may support packed input formats like

  @ByteString@ or @Text@.  Suggestions and patches are welcome.'

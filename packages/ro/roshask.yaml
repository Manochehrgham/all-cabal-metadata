description: ! 'Tools for working with ROS in Haskell.


  ROS (<http://www.ros.org>) is a software

  framework developed by Willow Garage

  (<http://http://www.willowgarage.com/>) that aims

  to provide a standard software architecture for

  robotic systems. The main idea of the framework

  is to support the development and execution of

  loosely coupled /Node/s connected by typed

  /Topic/s. Each Node represents a locus of

  processing, ideally with a minimal interface

  specified in terms of the types of Topics it

  takes as input and offers as output.


  This package provides libraries for creating new

  ROS Nodes in Haskell, along with the @roshask@

  executable for creating new ROS packages and

  generating Haskell code from message definition

  files (see the ROS documentation for information

  on message types).


  See

  <http://github.com/acowley/roshask/wiki> for more

  information on getting started.'

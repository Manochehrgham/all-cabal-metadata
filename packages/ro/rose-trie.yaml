description: ! '

  A rose tree is a tree of trees, where every node contains a leaf and set of

  sub-trees. A trie is a tree structure where each node can be accessed using a

  "path," where a path is a list of keys. A rose-trie does both. RoseTries are

  best used in situations where every leaf in the Trie needs to accessible by a

  list of polymorphic path elements.


  The underlying implementation is based on "Data.Map", from the Haskell

  Platform''s "containers" package. So unlike the ordinary rose tree, where each

  node contains a list of sub-trees, the RoseTrie contains a Map of sub-trees,

  where each key in the Map forms a single link in the trie path. As a result, the

  path for the RoseTrie is a list data type that is polymorphic over list elements

  which instantiate both the ''Prelude.Ord'' and ''Prelude.Eq'' type classes.


  Operating on a RoseTrie with a path of length @p@ performs up to @p@ times a

  number of @O(log n)@ Map operations on each of the sub-tree Map structures

  containing `n` elements, therefore path lookups and insertions in a RoseTrie

  data structure are on the order of @O(p * log n)@ time complexity.


  This library was originally part of the Dao package, but has been branched

  into it''s own package in the hopes that it will be useful in a wider

  variety of projects.'

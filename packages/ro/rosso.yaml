description: ! 'A miscellaneous collection of re-usable functions and data

  structures. Many of Rosso''s modules are direct extensions of the

  Haskell base libraries; for example, Data.Map.Rosso1 extends

  Data.Map, Control.Monad.Rosso1 extends Control.Monad, etc.


  Rosso is designed to remain backward-compatible with any client code

  that works with an older version of itself. To this end, all module

  names include explicit version numbers.'

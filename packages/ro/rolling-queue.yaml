description: ! 'This package provides a FIFO channel for STM supporting a size limit.  When

  this limit is reached, older entries are discarded to make way for newer

  entries.


  The motivation for this is logging.  If log entries are written to a plain

  @TChan@, the program will use a lot of memory if it produces log entries

  faster than they can be processed.  If log entries are written to a bounded

  channel where writes block (e.g. the @stm-chans@ package), the program may

  deadlock if the log channel fills up.  With ''Data.STM.RollingQueue'', old

  entries will be discarded instead.


  Possible improvements (not available in ''Data.STM.RollingQueue'') include:


  * Discard lower-priority entries first.


  * Discard every other entry, so some of the older entries will still be

  available.'

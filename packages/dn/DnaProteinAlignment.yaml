synopsis: Frameshift-aware alignment of protein sequences with DNA sequences

description: ! 'Perform a semi-global alignment of a DNA sequence (local) with

  a protein sequence (global). The alignment includes the

  possibility of frame shifts.


  The dynamic programming algorithm is created automatically from

  atomic single-tape grammars using our grammar product

  framework.


  Run the program with @+RTS -N -RTS@ for optimal performance

  when aligning against a genome.

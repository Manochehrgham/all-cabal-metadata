description: ! 'Performance Tests for the Haskell bindings for

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws Amazon Web Services (AWS)>.


  At the current stage this package only has tests for the DynamoDb

  bindings.


  /IMPORTANT NOTE/


  By using the dynamo-performace application from this package with your AWS API

  credentials costs will incure to your AWS account. Depending on the provisioned

  test table read and write throughput these costs can be in the order of several

  dollars per hour.


  Also be aware that there is an option to keep the table after the tests are finished

  (for example for usage with successive test runs). If you use that option you have
  to

  make sure that you delete the table yourself when you don''t need it any more.'

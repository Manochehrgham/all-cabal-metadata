description: ! 'Seqaid is a GHC plugin providing non-invasive auto-instrumentation
  of Haskell projects, for dynamic strictness (and parallelism) control. This will
  soon include optimisation for automated space leak relief using minimal strictification.
  [The optimiser is still in development however.]


  Refer to the seqaid <http://www.fremissant.net/seqaid homepage> for more information.

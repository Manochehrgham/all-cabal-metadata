description: ! 'While tinkering on a project, I frequently found myself

  having to make FFI calls to @select(2)@. This package provides an interface to that
  system call.


  Changed in version 0.4.0.1:


  * Minor internal cleanups.


  * TODO moved to file.


  Changes in version 0.4:


  * Introduce an interface to @fd_set@.


  * Add functions with various amounts of abstraction; in particular, ''select''''''

  matches ''select'' in previous versions.


  * Retry @select(2)@ in case of interruption by signals.


  * Remove dependence on the vector package.


  WARNINGS:


  * Behavior with write and exception file descriptors is under-tested.

  Feedback is welcome.


  * This package is far from complete, and should be tested throughly before being
  relied upon.


  /NOTE/: I feel I''m occupying prime namespace realestate with a package name

  like select. I''ll happily let myself be chased away if someone more qualified wants

  to use this package name. Let me know.'

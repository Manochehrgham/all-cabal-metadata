description: ! 'SECDH stands for "Stack-Environment-Code-Dump-Heap", and is an

  abstract machine based on Landin''s classic SECD machine for evaluation

  of lambda-calculus expressions. This machine adds a heap of suspension

  cells to the structure managed by the machine, allowing fully-lazy

  evaluation, similar to Haskell. The machine operates directly on the

  syntax tree, as Landin''s machine does. The entire implementation,

  including parser, evaluator, and garbage collector, occupies just over

  1100 lines of code.'

description: ! 'Solver for exact set cover problems.

  Included examples:

  Sudoku, 8 Queens,

  Soma Cube, Tetris Cube, Cube of L''s, Logika''s Baumeister puzzle.

  Generic algorithm allows to choose between

  slow but flexible @Set@ from @containers@ package

  and fast but cumbersome bitvectors.


  Build examples with @cabal install -fbuildExamples@.


  The package needs only Haskell 98.'

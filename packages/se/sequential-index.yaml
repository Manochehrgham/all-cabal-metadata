description: ! 'Sequential index numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 that allow arbitrarily
  inserting new numbers in between. They can possibly used for disk-based and other
  special containers, where adding a new element without changing the indexes of the
  other elements is important.

  Conceptually, SequentialIndex denotes a path to an element in an imaginary binary
  tree. However, leafs can only be on the right side of their parent. I.e. the path
  must end with a ''1'' (or be the path to the root node, 0.0). 1.0 denotes the invalid
  node.'

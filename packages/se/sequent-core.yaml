description: ! 'Sequent Core is a GHC plugin library based on a sequent calculus.
  It includes:


  *   A set of datatypes for a language expressing function code as /interactions/

  between values and their contexts (/continuations/)

  *   A library for writing GHC optimizer plugins using the Sequent Core

  language in place of the built-in Core language

  *   Example plugins written using Sequent Core'

description: ! 'There will be times when you have lots of set data and you want to
  perform many

  set operations quickly and reliably, you will also want to be able to add new

  data to your set operations and be able to run the same set operations with

  little effort. This is the problem that setdown aims to solve. Setdown was

  built with the intention that you would use it in conjunction with version

  control tools to manage your set data and set description file.'

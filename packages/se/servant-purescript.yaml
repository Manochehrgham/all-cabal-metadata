description: ! "Servant Purescript\n==================\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eskimor/servant-purescript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eskimor/servant-purescript)\n\nGenerate
  typed PureScript query functions for your servant-api. Find an example, including\nthe
  generated code in [examples/central-counter](https://github.com/eskimor/servant-purescript/tree/master/examples/central-counter).\n\n##
  Features\n\n - Typed serialization/deserialization taken care of by Haskell's aeson
  and PureScript's argonaut.\n   Generic encoding/decoding of both made compatible
  by not yet merged\n   [pull request](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-argonaut-codecs/pull/12).\n
  - You can put common parameters like Auth tokens and the base URL in a reader monad
  so you don't\n   have to pass them explicitly. This is configurable in the code
  generator with `readerParams` in `Settings`.\n\n## Status\n\nIt works!\n\nDocumentation
  is yet to come, but there is a usage example in examples/central-counter\nwhich
  also employs a very early version of servant-subscriber\nused for counter live updates.\nThe
  PureScript side of servant-subscriber is very low-level and will\nchange significantly
  in the future.\n\nFor type translations purescript-bridge is used.\n\nI now have
  to take care of my actual project, which makes use of servant-purescript,\nimprovements
  and documentation will follow on the way!\n"

description: ! 'The RNA sequence design problem asks for a single sequence that

  readily folds into the (one or more) structural targets that

  are given as input.


  This program expects on standard input a file with one or more

  structures and, possibly, additional sequence constraints in

  the form of an IUPAC string. It will then run a Markov chain to

  find a sequence that is optimal with regard to the structural

  targets and the user-defineable optimization function.


  The user can give different optimization criteria on the

  command line, akin to a simple calculator.


  For more details please consult:

  <https://github.com/choener/RNAdesign/blob/master/README.md>


  You can also run @RNAdesign --showmanual@ which will display

  the same @README.md@.

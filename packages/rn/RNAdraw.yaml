description: ! 'We provide a number of ways to draw RNA secondary structures.

  In particular, the following types of structures can be (more

  or less elegantly) drawn:


  * Dot plots for mfe and partition function


  * canonical RNA secondary structures without pseudoknots


  * non-canonical extended RNA secondary structures


  * pseudoknotted secondary structures


  From top to bottom, the beauty of presentation degrades. Some

  emphasis is put on ASCII-drawings, especially Vienna

  dot-bracket-like notation.'

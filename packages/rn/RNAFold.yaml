description: ! 'RNAfold v2 using the ADPfusion library. The RNAfold algorithm

  is used to determine how fast we can be compared to a highly

  optimized C program.


  Please use GHC 7.6 or newer.


  NOTE I''d like to rename this package to RNAfold, like the C

  implementation. Do not install "globally", especially if you

  normally use RNAfold from the ViennaRNA package, for obvious

  reasons.'

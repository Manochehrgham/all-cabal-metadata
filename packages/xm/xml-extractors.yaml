description: ! 'This is a library to simplify extraction of data from parsed xml.


  See the ''Text.XML.Light.Extractors'' module for an example.


  /Motivation/


  The `xml` package provides functions to parse and get information from

  xml data. It will parse an xml string into a generic tree

  representation. Extracting information from such a tree while

  keeping track of location to handle errors is tricky. This library

  helps with that.


  If there is an error during extraction (expected information is

  absent or wrong), it will return an error value with position information.


  /Some limitations/


  * Only handles unqualified names. (This is by design to simplify usage.)


  * No column number and sometimes no line number reference in error values.'

description: ! 'This package is deprecated in favor of xml-conduit.


  This package provides parsing and rendering functions for XML. It is based on the
  datatypes found in the xml-types package. This package is broken up into the following
  modules:


  * Text.XML: DOM-based parsing and rendering. This is the most commonly used module.


  * Text.XML.Cursor: A wrapper around "Text.XML" which allows bidirectional traversing
  of the DOM, similar to XPath. (Note: Text.XML.Cursor.Generic is the same concept,
  but will work with any node representation.)


  * Text.XML.Unresolved: A slight modification to "Text.XML" which does not require
  all entities to be resolved at parsing. The datatypes are slightly more complicated
  here, and therefore this module is only recommended when you need to deal directly
  with raw entities.


  * Text.XML.Stream.Parse: Streaming parser, including some streaming parser combinators.


  * Text.XML.Stream.Render: Streaming renderer.


  Additionally, the xml-hamlet package <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml-hamlet>
  provides a more convenient syntax for creating XML documents. For a more thorough
  tutorial on this library, please see <http://www.yesodweb.com/book/xml-enumerator>.'

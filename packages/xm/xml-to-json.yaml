description: ! 'The xml-to-json executable (and library) converts XMLs to json format,
  gaining readability while losing information such as comments, attribute ordering,
  and such.


  For files that are slow to process, please use ''xml-to-json-fast'' which (starting
  with version 2.0.0) resides in its own package.


  The original purpose was to convert legacy XML-based data into a format that can
  be imported into JSON databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB.


  The package also includes an executable to directly invoke the library on files
  (or urls on non-windows platforms).


  See <https://github.com/sinelaw/xml-to-json#readme> for details and usage.'

description: ! 'Contains renderers and parsers for both XML and HTML 5

  document fragments, which share data structures so that

  it''s easy to work with both.  Document fragments are bits

  of documents, which are not constrained by some of the

  high-level structure rules (in particular, they may

  contain more than one root element).


  Note that this is not a compliant HTML 5 parser.  Rather,

  it is a parser for HTML 5 compliant documents.  It does not

  implement the HTML 5 parsing algorithm, and should

  generally be expected to perform correctly only on

  documents that you trust to conform to HTML 5.  This is

  not a suitable library for implementing web crawlers or

  other software that will be exposed to documents from

  outside sources.  The result is also not the HTML 5

  node structure, but rather something closer to the physical

  structure.  For example, omitted start tags are not

  inserted (and so, their corresponding end tags must also be

  omitted).'

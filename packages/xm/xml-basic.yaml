description: ! 'We provide basic data types for XML representation,

  like names, attributes, entities.

  Yes we try hard to get type safe XML handling out of Haskell 98.

  We also provide information about exceptional HTML tags,

  like self-closing tags.

  This package provides common functionality

  that is both needed in list (tagsoup-ht) and tree (wraxml) representations of XML.'

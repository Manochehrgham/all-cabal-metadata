description: ! 'This module provides a set of functions for building simple command-line

  interfaces. It allows interfaces which collect values (such as Integers,

  Dates, or other structured values), build lists of values, and use simple

  menus. It is not intended to build complex interfaces with full cursor

  control. It is oriented towards line-based interfaces.'

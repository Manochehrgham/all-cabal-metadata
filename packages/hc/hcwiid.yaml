description: ! "This is a refurbished version of hcwiid. It will include most of cwiid,\nand
  I've already began to include extra functions that I find useful.\nIf you find something
  in cwiid which is not included here and you need it,\nplease let me know/send a
  pull request.\n\nFirst things first: How the frag do I compile the tests in test/?\n\nYou
  need to do two things:\n1) Compile the program with -rtsopts (enable RTS command
  line flags)\n2) Run the program with +RTS -V0\n   This will disable the internal
  ticks used for profiling, which\n   in turn will make the runtime system not use
  the SIGALRM signal,\n   which libluetooth uses for its own internal purposes and
  is necessary\n   to connect to the wiimote.\n\n   (This bit is the work of Paolo
  Capriotti, whose mastery of GHC\n    baffles me every time.)\n\nTODO\n========\n*
  Locate projects using this. (I am personally working on some games that will\nbe
  published.)\n* Write a decent example that uses more than just testing a button
  thing.\n"

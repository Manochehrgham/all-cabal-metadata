description: ! 'The library provides functions to read, write and manipulate MIDI,
  WAVE and SoundFont2 multimedia files. It is written entirely in Haskell (without
  any FFI). It uses efficient  parsing and building combinators for binary data stored
  in ByteStrings (based on the one in ''binary'' package).


  Correctness of significant parts of the library has been validated with QuickCheck
  and Haskell Program Coverage (HPC) tool-kits.'

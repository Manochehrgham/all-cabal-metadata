description: ! 'This package provides chunked XML parsing using iteratees.  It is
  especially suited

  to implementing XML-based socket protocols, but is useful wherever lazy parsing
  is

  needed on production systems where you can''t tolerate the problems that come with

  Haskell''s lazy I\/O.


  The XML is presented as a lazy tree, and is processed by a handler implemented using

  a monad transformer called XMLT.  The resulting monad is suspended whenever it tries

  to read a part of the tree that hasn''t been parsed yet, and continued as soon as
  it

  is available.

  The resulting code looks and functions very much as if you were using lazy I\/O,

  only without the associated problems. Your handlers can have effects, yet they

  come out in quite a functional style.


  Background:  Haskell''s lazy I\/O can be problematic in some applications because
  it

  doesn''t handle I\/O errors properly, and you can''t predict when it will clean
  up its

  resources, which could result in file handles running out.'

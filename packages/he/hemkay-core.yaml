description: ! 'Hemkay (An M.K. Player Whose Name Starts with an H) is a simple

  music module player that performs all the mixing in Haskell.  It

  supports the popular ProTracker format and some of its variations

  with different numbers of channels.


  This package contains the mixing routines, which can be reused in

  any application.  The output can be written into a file or played

  back in real time.'

description: ! 'Helium is a compiler for a subset of Haskell that aims at delivering
  high

  quality type error messages particularly for beginner programmers. It also

  includes facilities for specializing type error diagnosis for embedded domain

  specific languages. The compiler supports Haskell 98, but without the ability

  to define new type classes and instances.'

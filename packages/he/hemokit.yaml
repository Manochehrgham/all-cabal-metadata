description: ! 'This package allows reading raw data from the Emotiv EPOC EEG devices.


  It is inspired and based on the code of the Emokit project

  (<https://github.com/openyou/emokit>), but entirely written in Haskell.


  It contains an extensive, well-documented library for connecting to devices,

  decrypting the stream, and parsing the relevant data out.


  Data can be read from a given device via HIDAPI-hidraw or a dump file;

  reading from multiple devices is supported and when only one EEG is to

  be used, the correct device is automatically selected.


  There is also an executable, @hemokit-dump@, that can print out


  * raw data


  * incremental packets as sent from the device


  * the cumulative /state/ of the EEG


  in both their plain form and as JSON, and optionally serve any of this

  via Websockets.'

description: ! 'This package is a Haskell binding for Berkeley DB XML, which is a
  powerful,

  fully transactional, XML-based database written in C++ that uses XQuery as its

  query language.  It is NOT an SQL database.  It is not free for commercial use.


  The binding is only about 70% complete, but it should allow you to write a fairly

  serious application.  If you would like a particular part of the API added,

  please contact me.


  If Berkeley DB or DB XML is not installed in the default location of /usr or

  /usr/local, you will need to specify the paths in this way:


  > cabal install BerkeleyDBXML \

  >    --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/dbxml-2.5.16/include/ \

  >    --extra-include-dirs=/usr/local/dbxml-2.5.16/include/dbxml/ \

  >    --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/local/dbxml-2.5.16/lib/


  See the examples/ directory for examples.

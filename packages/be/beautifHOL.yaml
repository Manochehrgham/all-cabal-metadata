description: ! 'This is a pretty-printer for higher-order logic (HOL).  It reads in
  a formula

  and outputs it to standard out.  A paper describes its design and motivation

  at the project website.  The approach expands upon Leslie Lamport''s paper, \"How

  to Write a Long Formula,\" available at

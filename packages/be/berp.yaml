description: ! 'Berp is an implementation of Python 3, written in Haskell.

  It provides a compiler and an interpreter. In both cases

  the input Python program is translated into Haskell code.

  The compiler turns the Haskell code into machine code.

  The interpreter runs the Haskell code immediately via

  the GHCi interpreter. The user interface of the interpreter

  imitates the one provided by CPython.'

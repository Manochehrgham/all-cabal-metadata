description: ! 'This library contains Haskell bindings to the Betfair API.


  <https://developer.betfair.com/default/api-s-and-services/sports-api/sports-overview/>


  At the moment, the \''Betting API\'' and \''Heartbeat API\'' is implemented.

  The \''Accounts API\'' is not.


  See "Network.Betfair".


  CAUTION: These are experimental bindings. Because of the financially

  dangerous nature of betting, I advice you to have a contingency plan if

  something in the library breaks down.


  In particular, check the Betfair API documentation page for which version

  it is at the moment. This library is written against version 2.1.


  This library enforces limits on the number of calls you can do to Betfair

  API in a second, to help you avoid data charges. See

  "Network.Betfair.Unsafe".'

description: ! 'A perfect hashing library for mapping bytestrings to values.

  Insertion is not supported (by design): this is just a binding

  to the C-based CMPH library (http://cmph.sf.net). Only fromList

  and lookup operations are supported, but in many circumstances

  this is all that''s required.

description: ! 'Pesca is a program that helps in the construction of proofs

  in sequent calculus. It works both as a proof editor and as an automatic theorem

  prover. Proofs constructed in Pesca can both be seen on the terminal and printed

  into LaTeX files.


  The user of Pesca can choose among different versions of classical and

  intuitionistic proposition and predicate calculi, and extend them by systems of

  nonlogical axioms. The implementation of Pesca is written in the

  functional programming language Haskell.'

description: The intent of pec is to provide a drop-in replacement for C, but with
  modern language features.  Pec is a procedural language with a functional/declarative
  feel.  Programming in pec is very similar to monadic programming in Haskell.  The
  primary use case for pec is to provide a productive environment for writing safe,
  efficient, embedded applications.

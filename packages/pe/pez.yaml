description: ! 'PEZ is a generic zipper library. It uses lenses from the "fclabels"
  package to

  reference a \"location\" to move to in the zipper. The zipper is restricted to

  types in the ''Typeable'' class, allowing the user to \"move up\" through complex
  data

  structures such as mutually-recursive types.


  Both the Typeable class and fclabels lenses can be derived in GHC, making it

  easy for the programmer to use a zipper with a minimum of boilerplate.


  Please send any feature requests or bug reports along.

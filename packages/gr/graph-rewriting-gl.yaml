description: Once a graph rewriting system has been specified using the @graph-rewriting@
  library this package can be used to create an application that allows to experiment
  with this system by interactively applying the rewrite rules. The usage of the interface
  is the same for all applications. In the center you will see the graph. It might
  be moving around which is due the force-directed layouting. On the top-left corner
  you will find a menu with the individual rewriting rules of the rewriting system.
  The controls are described in the "GraphRewriting.GL.UI" module.

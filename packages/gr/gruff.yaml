description: ! 'Mandelbrot Set fractal explorer using the ruff library.


  Requires GTK, OpenGL, and GLSL fragment shader support; lots of RAM

  and multiple CPU cores recommended.


  If you want to explore very deep zooms, you''ll need hmpfr which

  currently requires GHC to be compiled with integer-simple instead of

  the default integer-gmp.  To install with MPFR support, use

  @cabal install gruff -fmpfr@.

  Note that the default setting for this flag has changed since gruff-0.2.


  gruff-0.3.4 updates dependencies for ghc-7.8.  Colouring is improved.


  gruff-0.3.3 relaxes dependencies for ghc-7.6.


  gruff-0.3.1 is a bugfix release, fixing a performance problem wherein

  offscreen tiles were needlessly calculated.  The performance gain

  is much less (and in many cases is in fact a performance loss) when

  using integer-simple.


  gruff-0.3 includes a small library to allow external programs to

  create diagrams and animations with gruff.  See the gruff-examples

  package.  The interface has been remodelled to simplify it and add

  informative feature overlays.


  gruff-0.2.1 was a bugfix release.  Changes since gruff-0.2:


  * Supersampling bugs are fixed (no more undocumented quantization

  leading to inconsistent appearance at different zoom levels).


  * Race condition bugs in cache management are fixed (no more

  incompletely rendered images).


  * Internal changes/refactoring to make future additions easier.


  Features in this version include:


  * Interactive fractal browser display with mouse controls:


  * Left click to zoom in (press shift for bigger jumps).


  * Right click to zoom out (press shift for bigger jumps).


  * Middle click to center.


  * Shift middle click to auto-focus.


  * Control left click to label with period.


  * Control right click to label with angled internal address (slow!).


  * Session persistance (stored in @~\/.gruff\/state.gruff@ - states can

  also be loaded from and saved to other files, including labels and

  rays).  Note that the file format is incompatible with previous

  releases of gruff.


  * Tile cache (by default in @~\/.gruff\/cache@ - symlink it somewhere

  with a few GB of space if you plan on exploring a lot).


  * Can use MPFR if desired for higher precision, allowing deeper

  zooms and locating high period nucleii.


  * Limited amount of customizable colouring (colours for interior,

  border, and exterior points, as well as labels and rays).


  * Supersampling for more detailed images (useful range is 1 to 16).


  * Rudimentary scripting support (see the gruff-examples package).


  Future versions will focus on enhancing the scripting support.'

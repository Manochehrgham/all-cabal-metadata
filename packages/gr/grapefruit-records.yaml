description: ! 'Grapefruit is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)

  with a focus on user interfaces. FRP makes it possible to

  implement reactive and interactive systems in a declarative

  style. To learn more about FRP, have a look at

  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_Reactive_Programming>.


  This package provides a record system for use with FRP.'

description: ! "# Graflog\n\nIn a distributed system, logging is hard. In order for
  distributed logging to be\nuseful, it needs to contain metadata about what caused
  it. Ideally, a given logged\nevent should tell us:\n- what user input caused it\n-
  what API call caused it\n- whether it is an error or not\n- its severity\n- a correlative
  id that allows us to find other log events related to it\n\nGraflog is primarily
  focused on the last piece. \n"

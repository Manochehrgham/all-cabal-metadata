description: Evaluate a given Î»-term (letrecs may be used) interactively. It uses
  duplicators to explicitly render fully-lazy sharing according to Wadsworth's approach.
  The reduction rules are split into two groups, safe rules and unsafe rules, which
  implement the procedure for unsharing the MFE under one duplicator.

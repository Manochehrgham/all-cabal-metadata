description: Lambdascope is an optimal evaluator of the λβ-calculus described in the
  paper "Lambdascope - Another optimal implementation of the lambda-calculus" by Vincent
  van Oostrom, Kees-Jan van de Looij, and Marijn Zwitserlood. Call "lambdascope" with
  one of the files from the "examples" directory as an argument. For usage of the
  GUI see "GraphRewriting.GL.UI". Use the "--lmo" flag for leftmost outermost evalution
  and "--bench" for non-graphical evaluation to weak head normal form.

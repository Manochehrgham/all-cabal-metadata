description: ! 'This library provides bindings for the Dot language used by the

  Graphviz (<http://graphviz.org/>) suite of programs for visualising

  graphs, as well as functions to call those programs.


  Main features of the graphviz library include:


  * Almost complete coverage of all Graphviz attributes and syntax.


  * Support for specifying clusters.


  * The ability to use a custom node type.


  * Functions for running a Graphviz layout tool with all specified

  output types.


  * The ability to not only generate but also parse Dot code with two

  options: strict and liberal (in terms of ordering of statements).


  * Functions to convert FGL graphs and other graph-like data structures

  to Dot code - including support to group them into clusters - with a

  high degree of customisation by specifying which attributes to use

  and limited support for the inverse operation.


  * Round-trip support for passing an FGL graph through Graphviz to

  augment node and edge labels with positional information, etc.'

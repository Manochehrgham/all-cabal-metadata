description: ! 'Generators for graphs.

  Supports classic (constant-sized) graphs, deterministic Generators

  and different random graph generators, based on mwc-random.


  This library uses a library-agnostic and space-efficient graph

  representation. Combinators are provided to convert said representation

  to other graph representations (currently only FGL, see ''Data.Graph.Generators.FGL'')


  Note that this library is in its early development stages.

  Don''t use it for production code without checking the correctness

  of the algorithm implementation.'

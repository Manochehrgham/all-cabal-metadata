description: ! 'Growler provides a very similar interface to scotty, with slight tweaks
  for performance and a few feature tradeoffs. Growler provides the ability to abort
  actions (handlers) with arbitrary responses, not just in the event of redirects
  or raising errors. Growler avoids coercing everything into lazy Text values and
  reading the whole request body into memory. It also eliminates the ability to abort
  the handler and have another handler handle the request instead (Scotty''s ''next''
  function).


  API is still in flux, so use at your own risk. Pull requests / issues are welcome.

synopsis: Type-safe datatype-database mapping library.
changelog: ! '0.7.0.1

  * Compatibility with template-haskell-2.10


  0.7.0

  * Instances of ToJSON for settings

  * Refactoring and export of some utility functions


  0.6.0

  * Entities without keys. It can be useful for many-to-many tables which hold keys
  but are not referenced

  * Entity and fields descriptions are parameterized so that they can be promoted

  * Entity and fields descriptions are dependent on database proxy. It allows to use
  different types depending on a database, for example, the same type can be array[]
  in PostgreSQL and varchar elsewhere

  * Migration support for indexes on expressions


  0.5.1

  * Export firstChar for creating user naming styles

  * Support entities with no fields


  0.5.0

  * Compatibility with GHC 7.8


  0.4.2.2

  * Create missing schemas (or databases in MySQL terminology) during migration

  * Replace datatype Proxy with type variable


  0.4.2

  * Switched from utf8-string to text


  0.4.0.3

  * Added "primitive" mapping which creates PrimitivePersistField instances based
  on Show/Read or Enum.


  0.4.0.2

  * Fixed order of unique constraint fields


  0.4.0.1

  * Fixed a warning in generated code


  0.4.0

  * References to tables not mapped by groundhog

  * Default column values

  * Check for already existing unique key phantom datatypes


  0.3.1

  * Generation of SinglePersistField and PurePersistField instances for keys


  0.3

  * Reference clauses ON DELETE and ON UPDATE

  * Schema qualification

  * Added unique constraints of type PRIMARY


  0.2

  * Improvements of YAML parsing error reporting

  * Database indexes

  * Support DB-specific column types


  0.1.0.3

  * Removed upper bound for bytestring

  * Support embedded datatypes as part of an unique constraint


  0.1.0.2

  * Removed upper bound for yaml


  0.1.0.1

  * Removed upper bound for containers


  0.1.0

  The first release. The modules were moved from the groundhog package.

  from `graphql-js` tests.\n- Golden test for `kitchen-sink.grahql` parsing.\n###
  Changed\n- Many optional data types in `GraphQl` didn't need to be wrapped in a
  `Maybe`.\n- Some `newtype`s became type synonyms for easier parsing.\n\n## 0.1 -

  [![Hackage Version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/graphql.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphql)

  [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jdnavarro/graphql-haskell.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jdnavarro/graphql-haskell)


  For now this only provides the data types to represent the GraphQL AST,

  but the idea is to be a Haskell port of

  [`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js). Next releases

  should include:


  - [x] GraphQL AST

  - [x] Parser for the GraphQL language. See TODO for caveats.

  - [ ] GraphQL Schema AST.

  - [ ] Parser for the GraphQL Schema language.

  - [ ] Interpreter of GraphQL requests.

  - [ ] Utilities to define GraphQL types and schema.


  See the TODO file for more concrete tasks.

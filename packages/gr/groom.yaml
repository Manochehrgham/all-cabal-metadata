description: ! 'Automatically derived Show instances are an easy way

  to inspect data in your program.  However, for large

  data-structures, the resulting output lacks

  whitespace, making it unreadable.  Groom offers an

  replacement to `show'' called `groom'' which attempts

  to pretty-print the output of `show''.  For example:


  > let x = parseExp "foobar 1 [1,2]"

  > in do

  >   putStrLn (show x)

  >   putStrLn (groom x)


  results in:


  > ParseOk (App (App (Var (UnQual (Ident "foobar"))) (Lit (Int 1))) (List [Lit (Int
  1),Lit (Int 2)]))

  > ParseOk

  >   (App (App (Var (UnQual (Ident "foobar"))) (Lit (Int 1)))

  >      (List [Lit (Int 1), Lit (Int 2)]))


  Groom works only on Show instances that output valid

  Haskell code; if Groom can''t understand its input,

  it will not make any changes.'

  Welcome to the `grouped-list` repository.


  We are at an early stage of development, but

  contributions are more than welcome. If you

  are interested, feel free to submit a pull

  request.


  # What is this about?


  This library defines the type of grouped lists,

  ``Grouped``. Values of this type are lists

  with a finite number of elements. The only

  special feature is that consecutive elements

  that are equal on the list are internally

  represented as a single element annotated

  with the number of repetitions. Therefore,

  operations on lists that have many consecutive

  repetitions perform much better, and memory

  usage is reduced. However, this type is suboptimal

  for lists that do not have many consecutive

  repetitions. We are trying to ameliorate this.

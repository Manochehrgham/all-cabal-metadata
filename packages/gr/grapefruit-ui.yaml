description: ! 'Grapefruit is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)

  with a focus on user interfaces. FRP makes it possible to

  implement reactive and interactive systems in a declarative

  style. To learn more about FRP, have a look at

  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_Reactive_Programming>.


  This package contains general user interface support. To make use

  of it, it has to be complemented by a UI backend. It is possible

  to have different UI backends implementing the same general

  interface on top of different UI toolkits. At the moment, the

  only backend is one based on GTK+. This is provided by the

  grapefruit-ui-gtk package.'

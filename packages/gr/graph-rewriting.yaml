description: This library provides a monadic EDSL to define your own port graph rewrite
  system in Haskell. Once you have specified the signature of your nodes and a set
  of rewrite rules, you can apply these rules on a graph to effect a graph transformation.
  The aim of this library is to make it as convenient as possible to define such a
  system and experiment with it and is not intended as a backend for high-performance
  computation.

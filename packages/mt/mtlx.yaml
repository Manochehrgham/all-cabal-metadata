description: ! 'A monad transformer library with type indexes, which allows the

  programmer to get a distinct copy of one of the monads without

  reproducing definitions and instances.  It currently

  supports IdentityX, ReaderX, StateX, WriterX, RWSX, and ErrorX

  monads (and their transformer versions).  All these copies can be

  combined into a transformer stack, including any of the original

  mtl monads. Inspired by the original mtl.  That library was

  inspired by the paper /Functional Programming with Overloading and

  Higher-Order Polymorphism/, by Mark P Jones

  (<http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html>), Advanced

  School of Functional Programming, 1995.  See the Examples.hs file

  for usage.'

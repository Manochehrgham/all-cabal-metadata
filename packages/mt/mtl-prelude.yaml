description: ! 'This package only exports definitions from the \"mtl\" and \"transformers\"

  libraries.

  Unlike every module of \"mtl\" it does not reexport

  @Control.Monad@ and @Control.Monad.Fix@.


  In combination with the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-prelude "base-prelude">
  library,

  this should give you a quite rich prelude.


  The @2.*@ versions are restricted by

  the feature set of @mtl == 2.2.*@ and @transformers == 0.4.*@.'

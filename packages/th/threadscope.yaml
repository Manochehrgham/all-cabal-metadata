description: ! 'ThreadScope is a graphical viewer for thread profile

  information generated by the Glasgow Haskell compiler

  (GHC).


  The Threadscope program allows us to debug the parallel

  performance of Haskell programs. Using Threadscope we can

  check to see that work is well balanced across the

  available processors and spot performance issues relating

  to garbage collection or poor load balancing.'

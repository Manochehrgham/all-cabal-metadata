description: ! '"thimk" (an old joke) is a command-line spelling word

  suggestion tool.  You give it a possibly-misspelled word,

  and it spits out one or more properly-spelled words in order

  of likelihood of similarity.


  The latest change to the implementation is an addition

  of an optional precompiled SQlite database of phonetic

  codes for the entire dictionary, created with

  "thimk-makedb".  This greatly speeds lookup, permitting

  reasonable performance on enormous dictionaries.'

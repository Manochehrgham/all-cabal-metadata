description: ! 'Threepenny-GUI is a GUI framework that uses the web browser as a display.


  It''s very easy to install because everyone has a web browser installed.


  A program written with Threepenny is essentially a small web server that

  displays the user interface as a web page to any browser that connects to it.

  You can freely manipulate the HTML DOM and handle JavaScript events

  from your Haskell code.


  Stability forecast: This is an experimental release! Send me your feedback!

  Significant API changes are likely in future versions.


  NOTE: This library contains examples, but they are not built by default.

  To build and install the example, use the @buildExamples@ flag like this


  @cabal install threepenny-gui -fbuildExamples@'

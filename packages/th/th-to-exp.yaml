  `th-to-exp` is a package that provides a way to persist data from compile-time to
  runtime by producing Template Haskell expressions that evaluate to particular values.
  For example, if you have a value `Just 1`, then `toExp (Just 1)` will produce the
  *expression* `[e| Just 1 |]`, which can be used in a splice. For a more direct example,
  hereâ€™s what that looks like without the quasiquote notation:


  ```haskell

  > toExp (Just 1)

  AppE (ConE GHC.Base.Just) (LitE (IntegerL 1))

  ```


  This is done by using a typeclass, `ToExp`, that can be automatically derived for
  types that have a `Generic` instance.

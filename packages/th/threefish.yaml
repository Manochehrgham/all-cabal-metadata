description: Implements 256 and 512 bit variants of Threefish and Skein. Skein is
  usable as a "normal" hash function as well as in Skein-MAC, as a cryptographically
  secure PRNG, as a stream cipher and as a key derivation function, all implemented
  according to the specifications of the Skein 1.3 paper.

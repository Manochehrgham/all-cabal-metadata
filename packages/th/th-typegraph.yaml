description: ! 'This package is not the successor to th-typegraph-0.43, it is

  a brand new package which forms the basis of a new package that

  what will eventually do what th-typegraph was supposed to.  What

  it *can* do is traverse the type "TypeQ", and includes versions

  of deriveSafeCopy and derivePathInfo that use the traversal to

  avoid adding phantom types to the context of the instance.'

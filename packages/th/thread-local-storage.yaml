description: ! '

  Thread-local storage, or TLS, is an important ingredient in many

  algorithms and data structures.


  The GHC compiler does not provide a built-in notion of TLS either

  at the IO-thread or OS thread level.  This package provides a few

  different implementations of a simple TLS API.


  All exported modules provide exactly the same interface with

  different implementations.  Run the included criterion benchmark

  suite to ascertain which performs the best on your platform.


  Example criterion benchmark data can be found here (from an Intel Ivy-Bridge i7-3770
  desktop):

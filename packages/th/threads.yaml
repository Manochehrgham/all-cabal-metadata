description: ! 'This package provides functions to fork threads and

  wait for their result, whether it''s an exception or a

  normal value.


  Besides waiting for the termination of a single thread

  this packages also provides functions to wait for a

  group of threads to terminate.


  This package is similar to the

  @threadmanager@, @async@ and @spawn@ packages.

  The advantages of this package are:


  * Simpler API.


  * More efficient in both space and time.


  * No space-leak when forking a large number of threads.


  * Correct handling of asynchronous exceptions.


  * GHC specific functionality like @forkOn@ and @forkIOWithUnmask@.'

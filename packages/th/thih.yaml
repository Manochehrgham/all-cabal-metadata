description: ! 'Haskell benefits from a sophisticated type system, but implementors,

  programmers, and researchers suffer because it has no formal description.

  To remedy this shortcoming, we present a Haskell program that implements

  a Haskell typechecker, thus providing a mathematically rigorous specification

  in a notation that is familiar to Haskell users. We expect this program to fill

  a serious gap in current descriptions of Haskell, both as a starting point

  for discussions about existing features of the type system, and as a platform

  from which to explore new proposals.


  This package is derived from the Haskell ''98 + Multiparameter Type Classes package
  of THIH.'

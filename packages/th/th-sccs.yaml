description: ! 'th-sccs exposes Template Haskell functions for computing the

  mutually recursive binding groups for data and type synonym

  declarations, excluding those that use type families.

  This includes a convenient type class for gathering the type

  constructor names that occur within a TH @Info@\/@Dec@\/@Type@

  value.'

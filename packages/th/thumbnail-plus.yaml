description: ! 'This package provides every tool you need to easily and safely

  generate thumbnails for JPG, GIF and PNG images.


  By safely, we mean that this package should be able to handle

  images uploaded to a public web server without any known

  vulnerabilities:


  * File sizes are constrained and checked.


  * Image sizes are constrained and checked before the images

  are loaded into memory.  Uses @imagesize-conduit@ by Michael

  Snoyman.


  * Optionally, the original image is reencoded before being

  saved.


  * The images are processed using the <http://libgd.bitbucket.org/ GD library>,

  which is heavily battle-tested and

  <http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2678/Gd-Graphics-Library.html
  audited by many pairs of eyeballs>.


  Please report any vulnerabilities you may find, we take strive

  to make this library suitable for processing arbitrary images.'

description: ! 'A grab bag of functions for use with Template Haskell.


  This is basically the place I put all my ugly CPP hacks to support

  the ever-changing interface of the template haskell system by

  providing high-level operations and making sure they work on as many

  versions of Template Haskell as I can.'

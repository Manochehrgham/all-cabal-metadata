description: ! 'Takes an optional argument which is the number

  of threads (the default is three).  Give it the commands to run, one

  per line, through standard input.

  You may use blank lines to divide the commands into sections.  The

  commands in a section will not be started until all the commands in

  previous sections are complete.  Each section can be given its own

  thread count.'

description: ! "# THEff\r\n  This package implements effects, as alternative to monad\r\n
  \ transformers. Actually, the effects themselves are created without \r\n  the use
  of TH, but the binding of nested effects described by \r\n  mkEff splice. \r\n  For
  more information about extensible effects , see the original paper at\r\n  <http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/exteff.pdf>.\r\n
  \ But, this package is significantly different from the original.\r\n  It uses a
  chains of ordinary GADTs created by TH. \r\n  No Typeable, unsafe... , ExistentialQuantification

description: ! 'This package provides the Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar module, which
  desugars

  Template Haskell''s rich encoding of Haskell syntax into a simpler encoding.

  This desugaring discards surface syntax information (such as the use of infix

  operators) but retains the original meaning of the TH code. The intended use

  of this package is as a preprocessor for more advanced code manipulation

  tools. Note that the input to any of the ds... functions should be produced

  from a TH quote, using the syntax [| ... |]. If the input to these functions

  is a hand-coded TH syntax tree, the results may be unpredictable. In

  particular, it is likely that promoted datatypes will not work as expected.'

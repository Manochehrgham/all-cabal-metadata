description: ! 'Haskell bindings for the Apache Thrift RPC system. Requires the use
  of the thrift code generator.

  Includes backported Framed Transport implementation, which Cassandra now uses by
  default[1].


  NOTE: this package will be eventually deprecated, replaced by Christian Lavoie''s
  thrift package[2],

  once Framed Transport support that is in Thrift''s svn trunk (and backported here)
  is included there.

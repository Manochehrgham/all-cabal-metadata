description: ! 'Small and simple library for computing values of Theta functions.

  They''re the special functions of two variables. Described very well at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_function>.

  Library exports four theta-functions and a small helper to calculate their second
  parameter.

  Theta functions are functions of Complex variables, FYI.'

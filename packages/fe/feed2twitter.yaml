description: ! 'Reads feeds and tweets each post to a Twitter account.

  This is both a library and a simple executable build on top

  of it.


  The feed is read only once. To keep updating, call this

  program/library every few minutes.

  A local cache of earlier tweets is kept in a file to make

  sure no duplicates are sent.


  To build your own program on top of this library use the

  `atom2twitter` or `rss2twitter` functions. If you need

  access to the complete feed instead of just individual

  individual items, use the `feed2twitter` function.


  See the `hackage2twitter` program for an example of how to

  use this library.


  The executable can be used as such:


  > $ feed2twitter http://example.com/feed.rss username password cache-file 50 [--debug-mode]'

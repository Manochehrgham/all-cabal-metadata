description: ! 'This code, based on zfec by Zooko, based on code by Luigi

  Rizzo implements an erasure code, or forward error

  correction code. The most widely known example of an erasure

  code is the RAID-5 algorithm which makes it so that in the

  event of the loss of any one hard drive, the stored data can

  be completely recovered.  The algorithm in the zfec package

  has a similar effect, but instead of recovering from the loss

  of only a single element, it can be parameterized to choose in

  advance the number of elements whose loss it can tolerate.'

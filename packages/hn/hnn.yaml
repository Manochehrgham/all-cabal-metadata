description: ! '

  A neural network library implemented purely in Haskell, relying on the

  hmatrix library.


  This library provides a straight and simple feed-forward neural networks implementation
  which

  is way better than the one in hnn-0.1, in all aspects. It also provides a simple
  and little tested

  implementation of recurrent neural networks.


  If you''re interested in the feed-forward neural networks, please read the mini-tutorial
  on

  @AI.HNN.FF.Network@.'

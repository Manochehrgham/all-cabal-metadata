description: ! 'Unicoder is a command-line tool transforms text documents, replacing
  simple

  patterns with unicode equivalents. The patterns can be easily configured by

  the user.

  This package is especially meant to open the vast and expressive array

  of unicode identifiers to programmers and language designers, but there''s

  nothing wrong with a technically savvy user putting unicoder to work

  on documents for human consumption.

  Any system of special characters can be made easy to type on any keyboard

  and in any context as long as unicode supports it.


  Cabal wants to fight me over typesetting some examples, so check out

  <http://zankoku-okuno.viewdocs.io/unicoder/ the real docs>

  for a decent look at the features.


  In the interests of giving readers /some/ idea whats going on,

  with the default settings,


  > \E x. \A y. x \-> y

  > \l x,y. x \of x \of y


  becomes


  > ∃x ∀y x → y

  > λ x,y. x ∘ x ∘ y


  except that the newline isn''t removed (thanks, cabal!). Also, there are a couple

  important features that I can''t seem to get cabal to even parse (thanks again!).'

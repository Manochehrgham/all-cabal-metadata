synopsis: Generic support for programming with names and binders
changelog: ! "Version 0.2: 24 March 2011\n\n  * Initial release to go along with submission
  of \"Binders Unbound\".\n\nVersion 0.2.1: 28 March 2011\n\n  * Massive update to
  documentation.\n\nVersion 0.2.2: 29 March 2011\n\n  * Add MonadFix instances for
  FreshM and LFreshM.  Thanks to Job\n    Vranish for the suggestion.\n\nVersion 0.2.3:
  20 April 2011\n\n  * Fix minor bugs in\n    - tutorial/Tutorial.lhs\n    - examples/Abstract.hs\n
  \   - examples/STLC.hs\n\n    Thanks to Ki Yung Ahn for the reports.\n\nVersion
  0.2.5: 13 July 2011\n\n  * Fix bug in mkPerm which caused unbind2 to unexpectedly
  fail when\n    dealing with binders with non-disjoint sets of names.\n\n    Thanks
  to Sean Leather for the report.\n\n  * Clean up some compiler warnings.\n\nVersion
  0.3: 24 August 2011\n\n  * New permutation- and set-binding functions, for creating
  binders\n    which don't care about the order of multiple bound names, and/or\n
  \   about unused bound names.\n\n  * Bump RepLib dependency to 0.5, which now has
  support for GADTs\n    without existential type variables.\n\nVersion 0.3.1: 25
  August 2011\n\n  * Update to build on GHC 7.2.1\n\nVersion 0.4: 15 March 2012\n\n
  \ * Update to build on GHC 7.4.1\n\n  * add MonadWriter instances for FreshMT and
  LFreshMT\n\n  * Make 'getAvoids' function into a method of the LFresh class\n\nVersion
  0.4.0.1: 23 March 2012\n\n  * Remove broken links from documentation\n\nVersion
  0.4.0.2: 10 April 2012\n\n  * Bump 'mtl' upper bound to allow mtl-2.1\n\nVersion
  0.4.1: 5 June 2012\n\n  * Patch from Vilhelm SjÃ¶berg changing acompareR1 to return
  EQ for\n    Abstract1\n\nVersion 0.4.1.1: 21 Aug 2012\n\n  * Bump containers upper
  bound and test with GHC 7.6.1\n\nVersion 0.4.2: 15 July 2013\n\n  * remove derived
  instances: MonadState for FreshMT and MonadReader\n    for LFreshMT.  No one should
  have been using these anyway, and\n    they made it impossible to use these transformers
  together with\n    your own state.\n\n  * added unbind variants [l]unbind{23}Plus
  for conveniently unbinding\n    in a MonadPlus context.\n\nVersion 0.4.3: 29 January
  2014\n\n  * Add Binary instances for Name, GenBind, Rebind, and Embed.\n\n    Note
  that although the PVP requires a major version bump for added\n    instances, it
  was impossible to write these instances outside of\n    the package, so there is
  no danger of breakage.\n\nVersion 0.4.3.1: 8 May 2014\n\n  * Allow transformers-0.4
  and mtl-2.2"

description: ! 'A simple universal unarchiving utility.  Just point it at any

  archive or compressed file, and it spits out a single file or

  directory in the current directory with its contents.  Use -d to

  delete the original archive on success.  Use -f to overwrite any

  existing file or directory which might be in the way.'

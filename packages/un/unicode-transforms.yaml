description: ! '# Unicode Transforms

  This is a lightweight Haskell library supporting commonly used unicode

  transformations (currently only normalizations) on `ByteStrings` (UTF-8) and

  `Text`.


  Haskell package `text-icu` provides a comprehensive set of unicode transforms.

  The drawback of `text-icu` is that it requires you to install the ICU library

  OS packages first. This package is self contained and aims to provide an API

  similar to `text-icu` so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the

  features it supports.


  ## Features

  Unicode normalization in NFC, NFKC, NFD, NFKD forms is supported. This version

  of the library supports unicode versions upto 5.1.0.


  ## Documentation

  Please see the haddock documentation available with the package.


  ## Implementation


  This package is implemented as bindings to the `utf8proc` C utility. The

  utf8proc version bundled with this package is taken from the [xqilla

  project](http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/HomePage) (xqilla version 2.3.2).


  In future the underlying `utf8proc` implementation will get replaced by a

  Haskell implementation supporting the latest unicode versions.

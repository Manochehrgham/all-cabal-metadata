description: ! 'The units package provides a mechanism for compile-time

  dimensional analysis in Haskell programs. It defines an embedded

  type system based on units-of-measure. The units defined are fully

  extensible, and need not relate to physical properties.

  The package supports defining multiple inter-convertible units,

  such as Meter and Foot. When extracting a number from a

  dimensioned quantity, the desired unit must be specified, and the

  value is converted into that unit.

  If you are looking for specific systems of units (such as SI),

  please see the `units-defs` package.

  The Haddock documentation is insufficient for using the units

  package. Please see the README file, available from the package

  home page.'

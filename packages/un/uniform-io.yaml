description: ! 'This library defines a typeclass for abstracting

  the differences between the several IO channels available.

  It also includes implementations for standard IO, files and

  network IO, and easy to use TLS wrapping of any of those.

  Currently TLS only wraps sockets, std streams are not exported

  and there''s no support for TLS certificate verification. Those

  are all planned to be added soon.

  Requires a ''-threaded'' compiler switch.'

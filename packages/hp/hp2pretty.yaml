description: ! "hp2pretty\n=========\n\nhp2ps is a tool to generate PostScript graphs
  of Heap Profiles.\nhp2pretty is a rewrite of hp2ps, implemented in Haskell, with\nthe
  aims of being maintainable, with more flexible output, and\nmore beautiful output.
  \ Currently hp2pretty outputs Scalable\nVector Graphics (SVG) only, though PostScript
  (PS) is planned.\nAlso none (count'em) of hp2ps' options are implemented yet in\nhp2pretty.\n\n\nBenchmarks\n==========\n\nhp2pretty-0.1\n-------------\n\n$

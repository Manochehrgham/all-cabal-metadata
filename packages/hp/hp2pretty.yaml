description: ! 'hp2pretty is a rewrite of hp2ps, implemented in Haskell, with

  the aims of being maintainable, with more flexible output, and

  more beautiful output.  Currently hp2pretty outputs Scalable

  Vector Graphics (SVG) only, though PostScript (PS) is planned.

  Also none (count''em) of hp2ps'' options are implemented yet in

  hp2pretty.


  In hp2pretty-0.6 ByteString is replaced by Text, fixing bugs

  with Unicode.


  In hp2pretty-0.5 using attoparsec and floatshow internally

  should give a healthy speedup.


  In hp2pretty-0.4 usage changed since the previous release:


  hp2pretty *.hp


  hp2pretty --uniform-scale=time   *.hp


  hp2pretty --uniform-scale=memory *.hp


  hp2pretty --uniform-scale=both   *.hp


  Colours also changed: now they are based on a hash of the

  cost label, which should make colours have stable semantics

  across program runs.'

description: ! 'An incomplete component of the Hpc toolkit which provides the

  ability to step through coverage ticks as they happen, giving a

  poor mans debugger.  Requires the binary being traced to be build

  using a specific version of ghc-6.7, so YMWV.

  The plan is to port this to the new GHC API, giving both tracing

  and free variable examination via an Ajax interface.'

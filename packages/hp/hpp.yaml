description: ! '@hpp@ is a Haskell pre-processor that is also a

  C89/C90-compatible pre-processor (with the addition of a

  @--cpp@ flag). It is packaged as both a library and

  an executable.


  To use as a Haskell preprocessor for resolving @#ifdef@

  conditionals and simple macro expansion while still

  allowing multi-line string literals, an invocation might

  look like,


  @

  hpp -DDEBUG Foo.hs

  @


  To use as a C preprocessor, an invocation might look

  like,


  @

  hpp -DDEBUG --cpp foo.c

  @


  To have GHC use @hpp@ as the C pre-processor, add this

  line to the top of a Haskell source file that makes use

  of the @CPP@ @LANGUAGE@ pragma.

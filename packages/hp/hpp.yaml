synopsis: A Haskell pre-processor
changelog: ! '# 0.3.1


  Address a change wherein GHC 8 will pass `-include` arguments without a space between
  "-include" and the file to be included.


  # 0.3


  Switch to a stream processing model.


  This library is designed to have minimal dependencies, so we now have

  a bespoke implementation of a cross between the pipes and machines

  libraries included.


  This change was done to make some parsing

  operations easier, believe it or not. For example, most pre-processing

  is done on a line-by-line basis, but we must also support macro

  function applications that cross line boundaries. Thus the expansion

  logic can not merely be given one line at a time from an input

  file. Previously, a heuristic tried to combine consecutive lines

  before the parsing stage. Now, the parser itself is able to pull

  tokens in across lines when necessary.


  TL;DR: The upshot is that processing `/usr/include/stdio.h` on OS X (a

  surprisingly complicated file!)  now uses 78% of the time and 0.38%

  the memory of previous versions of `hpp`.


  # 0.1


  First release!

description: ! '@hpp@ is a Haskell pre-processor that is also a

  C89/C90-compatible pre-processor (with the addition of a

  @--cpp@ flag). It is packaged as both a library and

  an executable.


  To use as a Haskell preprocessor for resolving @#ifdef@

  conditionals and simple macro expansion while still

  allowing multi-line string literals, an invocation might

  look like,


  @

  hpp -DDEBUG Foo.hs

  @


  To use as a C preprocessor, an invocation might look

  like,


  @

  hpp -DDEBUG --cpp foo.c

  @


  To have GHC use @hpp@ as the C pre-processor, add this

  line to the top of a Haskell source file that makes use

  of the @CPP@ @LANGUAGE@ pragma.

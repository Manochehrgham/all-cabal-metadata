description: ! 'A rudimentary library that demonstrates the

  possibility of using Hpc (Haskell Program Coverage)

  to inspect the state of a running Haskell program.

  Use of the library involves a simple change of the

  main function and also requires the program to be

  enabled for hpc. At the time of writing, this means

  using a fairly recent version of GHC and compiling

  the Haskell code with the @-fhpc@ option.'

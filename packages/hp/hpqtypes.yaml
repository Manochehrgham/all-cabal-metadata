description: ! 'Efficient and easy-to-use bindings to (slightly modified)

  libpqtypes, lipq extension that adds support for binary

  transport format and composite types.


  Since modified libpqtypes is used, its source code is bundled

  along with the bindings. The differences between verbatim

  libpqtypes and the one used by this package:


  * per-thread global error structures were replaced by explicit

  passing of these structures around so that there is no need

  to use bound threads.


  * handlers that take values to be put into the database were

  modified to always expect pointers to objects, as opposed

  to previous situation where primitives were being taken by

  value (which was convenient if the library was used directly

  from C, but created inconsistency problems while trying to

  define bindings in a sensible way).

  examples> directory.'

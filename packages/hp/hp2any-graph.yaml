description: ! 'This package contains two utilities: a grapher that can display heap

  profiles in real time both for local and remote processes, and a

  relay application the grapher connects to in the latter case.

  Additionally, the graphing capability is exposed to other programs

  as well in the form of a library module.


  To avoid the need for OpenGL on the server side, the package can be

  built with the @ServerOnly@ flag:


  @cabal install --flags=serveronly@'

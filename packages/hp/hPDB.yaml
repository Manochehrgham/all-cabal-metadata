description: ! 'Protein Data Bank file format is a most popular format for holding
  biological macromolecular data.


  This is a very fast sequential parser:


  * below 7s for the largest entry in PDB - 1HTQ which is over 70MB - as compared
  with


  * 11s of RASMOL 2.7.5,


  * or 2m15s of BioPython with Python 2.6 interpreter.


  In its parallel incarnation it is most probably the fastest parser for PDB format.


  It is aimed to not only deliver event-based interface, but also a high-level data

  structure for manipulating data in spirit of BioPython''s PDB parser.

description: ! '@uhttpc@ contains a simple low-level and lightweight Haskell

  <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616 HTTP 1.1>

  library optimized for providing the bare minimum required for HTTP

  benchmarking purposes and allowing for time measurements of the

  individual phases of the HTTP transaction.


  This package also provides the command-line tool @uhttpc-bench@ as an

  usage example which mimics the popular

  <https://github.com/lighttpd/weighttp weighttp> HTTP benchmarking tool''s

  CLI.


  WARNING: @uhttpc@ was originally developed for evaluating the new

  <http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hask035-voellmy.pdf \"Mio\"
  parallel I/O manager>

  introduced with GHC 7.8 and provide a base-line for HTTP client libraries.

  However, this is not a fully RFC compliant HTTP client library and

  therefore ought not be used as a general purpose HTTP

  implementation; Use libraries such as

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-streams http-streams>

  instead which aim toward full RFC compliance as well as having good

  performance.'

synopsis: Part of UHC packaged as cabal/hackage installable library
changelog: ! '# Changelog


  ## 1.1.9.0 - 20150430


  - [compatibility] ghc 7.10 compat, name clash of ''Alt'' apparently now globally
  visible


  ## 1.1.8.12 - 20150430


  - [compatibility] ghc 7.10 compatibility, indirectly via uhc-util

  - [build] Initial work on sandbox builds, to be enabled by --enable-sandbox flag
  to ./configure. Does not work yet.

  - [build] Strict version equality dependency on uhc-util, uulib

  - [core api] Core api no longer needs ANormal patch ([#50](https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc/pull/50)).


  ## 1.1.8.10 - 20150327


  - [build] Internal compilerdriver refactorization and start of rewrite with new
  compilerdriver based on a simple incremental DSL for describing compilation.


  ## 1.1.8.9 - 20150301


  - [build] Intro of dependency on template haskell due to start of use of a lens
  library (fclabels, via uhc-util)

  - [git] Tagging of versions, change in changelog maintenance (is not created from
  edit version, prepending version nr etc)


  ## 1.1.8.8 - 20150301


  - unused version


  ## 1.1.8.7 - 20150219


  - [compiler driver] Refactoring: top level compiler driver functions now are typed
  as monad transformer, requiring adapted uhc-utils>=0.1.5.0.

  - [corerun] More primitives implemented.

  - [corerun] CoreRun files can be serialized, now also generated by default (enabling
  direct running these).


  ## 1.1.8.6


  - [build] fix for uhc-light-1.1.8.5 package build failure.


  ## 1.1.8.5


  - [uhcr] Can run Core directly, on the fly compilation to CoreRun.

  - [corerun] Generic (un)marshalling for CoreRun FFI.

  - [core, api] Export of data types, new Core AST/API to express this.

  - [corerun] Better fix for CoreRun access of globals during global init.


  ## 1.1.8.4 - 20150120


  - [corerun] Fix for module references during module setup (came up during CCO).

  - [corerun] Work on FFI bindings.


  ## 1.1.8.3 - 20141226


  - [corerun, api] Changes required for CCO.


  ## 1.1.8.2 - 20141219


  - [build] Fixes some GHC 7.8.3 Typeable warnings

  - [core, api] Removed broken default alternative from case expressions API


  ## 1.1.8.1 - 20141217


  - [core] Core prettyprinting/parsing changed such that bindings (in a let) and alternatives
  (of a case) now are semicolon terminated instead of curly embraced semicolon separated;
  should improve readability.

  - [build] Separate target in makefiles for ''ehcr'', with trace option.

  - [corerun, api] CoreRun API extended to be usable by CCO lab exercise.


  ## 1.1.8.0 - 20141212


  - [corerun, api] CoreRun has its own API.

  - [core, api] Interface to Core main changed in that the state parameter is already
  passed explicitly (not implicitly added during later compiler pipeline stages),
  influences the api.

  - [corerun] Cleaned up CoreRun AST, spec of the operational semantics under development
  (separate outside src/doc tree).

  - [feature] Separate executable ''uhcr'' as part of uhc-light for running CoreRun
  file .rcr as pretty printed by dump, a temporary solution.

  - [corerun] Parser for CoreRun.


  ## 1.1.7.4 - 20141203


  - [core] Detection of yes/no ANormal form of parsed Core and corresponding no/yes
  transformation (not tested for cases where it matters; unknown whether this is good
  enough for codegen to work properly)

  - [cleanup] Removal of src/ruler from source tree (has its own repo)

  - [api] Added better documentation and one small example program

  - [api] Fix issue #36 (wrong runtime behaviour and/or crashes)


  ## 1.1.7.3 - 20141127


  - [core] Core running engine works (FFI stuff still to be done).

  - [api] Core.API made more consistent.


  ## 1.1.7.2 - 20141126


  - [core] Core allows exports, can mix .hs and .bcr/.tcr files (tested rudimentary
  only).

  - [api] Core.API extended.


  ## 1.1.7.1 - 20141119


  - [api] Initial Core.API ([#31](https://github.com/UU-ComputerScience/uhc/pull/31)).

  - [feature] Start with changelog.


  ## 1.1.7.0 - 20141118


  - [feature] Initial cabal/hackage distribution tryout.

description: A 'light' variant of UHC including only an API and executables for compiling
  to Core representation (uhcl) and running CoreRun (uhcr). This version is just to
  test the infrastructure. Later versions will provide a fleshing out of the API and
  completion of the now rudimentary platform independent (Haskell) interpreted running
  etc..

description: ! 'A version of IntMap that uses the Enum typeclass instead of Int. This
  is

  very nearly a direct copy of the IntMap package by Daan Leijen and

  Andriy Palamarchuk. The only change is coercing the package to accept

  anything with the Enum class constraint instead of forcing Int''s.'

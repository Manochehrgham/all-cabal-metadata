description: ! '@env-parser is a small library for configuring programs based on information

  from the environment. It''s goals and design are similar to that of @cmdargs@

  or @optparse-applicative@ but aimed at automatically managed programs such as

  those that might be run via Heroku or Runit/daemontools.


  @env-parser@ intentionally sacrifices power for comprehensibility---the

  primary interface, @Parser@, implements only @Applicative@. This provides

  better runtime error messages and automatically generated static help using

  parser annotations. It also expresses a principle of simplicity in

  configuration: arbitrary uses of @Monad@ or even @Alternative@ can lead to

  opaque failures prior to a program even beginning to run.'

description: ! 'A library providing tools for building enumeration procedures for
  recursively-

  enumerable datatypes.  This is built atop the arith-encode library, and makes

  use of the natural number isomorphisms it provides to represent individual

  decisions in the enumeration procedure.  As such, each enumeration result is

  denoted by a unique path, consisting of a sequence of natural numbers.  An

  enumeration procedure is simply a (partial) mapping between sequences

  and a given datatype.


  The library provides functionality for constructing enumeration procedures,

  as well as facilities for performing enumeration according to various search

  strategies (depth-first, breadth-first, etc).  These procedures can also be

  "warm-started" using a path or a set of paths.  Obvious applications include

  exhaustive search, testing, automated proving, and others.


  Additionally, as a path is simply a sequence of natural numbers, an

  enumeration procedure can double as a binary serializer/deserializer.  For

  well-behaved enumeration procedures (ie. those where the mapping is an

  isomorphism), the resulting binary format should be very nearly succinct.


  This is the first release candidate for 1.0 (initial release)'

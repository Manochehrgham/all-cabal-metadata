description: ! 'With this package you can create a type safe interface to flag sets.

  It is intended for interfacing to C libraries via FFI,

  where Word8, Word16, or Word32 types are commonly used to store bit vectors.

  E.g. the type @EnumSet Word16 Ordering@

  represents a flag set stored in a Word16

  that supports the flags @LT@, @EQ@, @GT@.


  This package is similar to the @bitset@ package and

  the @Data.Edison.Coll.EnumSet@ module in the @edison@ package,

  however our implementation allows you to choose the embedding type

  and thus the maximum size of the set.'

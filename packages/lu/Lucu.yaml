description: ! 'Lucu is an HTTP daemonic library. It can be embedded in any

  Haskell program and runs in an independent thread.  Lucu is

  not a replacement for Apache or lighttpd. It is intended to be

  used to create an efficient web-based RESTful application

  without messing around FastCGI. It is also intended to be run

  behind a reverse-proxy so it doesn''t have some facilities like

  logging, client filtering or such like.'

description: ! '> Create ctags compatible tags files for Haskell programs

  >

  > Similar programs are [hasktags][1], [gasbag][2], [hothasktags][3], and GHC''s

  > builtin ctags generation.

  >

  > lushtags differs from these by being designed to have smooth integration with

  > the [Vim Tagbar][4] plugin.

  >

  > Tagbar is nice because it deals with creating tags automatically. There is no

  > need to manually run commands or keep track of tag files. Just open any Haskell

  > file in Vim and the Tagbar window will instantly show an interactive browsable

  > list of all the functions and declarations in the file. This window also

  > updates automatically as you edit the file.

  >

  > The tags created by lushtags are marked with several extensions, so that when

  > used with Tagbar you get these features:

  >

  > - Type signatures are displayed for functions.

  > - Tags are properly scoped so that, for example, data declarations appear as a

  >   tree with their constructors scoped as children.

  > - Definitions that are exported from the module are marked as "public" and

  >   appear emphasized in Tagbar.

  > - Tag locations are internally stored as patterns, not line numbers, so that

  >   you can correctly jump to tags even if they have moved in the source code

  >   during editing.

description: ! 'Like parser combinators? Building a big parser? Save hundreds of

  sloc, hours of debuging and several headaches by using Luthor

  on top of the familiar Parsec library.


  Parsec works great for small parsers, but as the size of the

  parser grows, complexity can grow exponentially without taking

  serious and tricky precautions. Luthor provides reusable

  utilities to isolate the complex parts of parsing.

  Amonst its weaponry are 1) more composable combinators,

  2) pre-built token parsers, 3) tools to build a scannerful parser,

  and 4) tools to work with indentation.

  Luthor reduces overall complexity, generally increases performance

  and error reporting, and cuts down on wheel re-invention.


  BIG CAVEAT: It is difficult to understand all the ways in which

  Parsec fails to be composable, so there may be some combinators

  in Luthor which fail to be composable. If you''re getting weird

  (i.e. Parsec-like) results, add a @try@ and please report.'

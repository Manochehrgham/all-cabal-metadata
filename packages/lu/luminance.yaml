description: ! 'This package exposes several modules to work with /GPUs/ in a stateless
  and

  type-safe way. Currently, it uses __OpenGL__ as backend hardware technology but

  others will be added later on, such as __Vulkan__.


  The initial unstable version is /0.1/. Consider everything in that version as

  part of an experiment, even though the library should be free of bugs. If you

  find any, please report an issue. If you think something could be enhanced,

  feel free to fill in an issue as well.


  One very important point is the fact that __luminance__ has nothing to do with

  /3D engines/ or /scene development kits/. Don’t expect to find /materials/,

  /lights/ or /mesh/ loaders. It’s just a graphics framework initiated to fix the

  design choices of __OpenGL__. It won’t change in any other way.


  __luminance__ is a small yet powerful graphics API. It was designed so that

  people can quickly get their feet wet and start having fun with graphics in

  /Haskell/. The main idea is to unleash the graphical and visual properties of

  /GPUs/ in a stateless and type-safe way.


  This library doesn’t expose any architectural patterns or designs. It’s up to

  you to design your program as you want and following your own plans.'

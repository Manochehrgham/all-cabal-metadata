description: ! 'This package exposes several modules to work with /GPU/ in a stateless
  and

  type-safe way. Currently, it uses **OpenGL** as backend hardware technology but

  others will be added later on, such as **Vulkan**.


  The initial unstable version is /0.1/. Consider everything in that version as

  part of an experiment, even though the library should be free of bugs. If you

  find any, please report an issue. If you think something could be enhanced,

  feel free to fill in an issue as well.


  One very important point is the fact that **luminance** has nothing to do with

  /3D engines/ or /scene development kits/. Don’t expect to find /materials/,

  /lights/ or /mesh/ loaders. It’s just a graphics framework initiated to fix the

  design choices of **OpenGL**. It won’t change in any other way.'

description: ! 'Port of netwire-input-glfw example to VinylGL & GLSL 1.50. Uses Netwire
  5 and Vinyl >= 0.4. NetVinylGLFW is a previous combination of Netwire, VinylGL,
  & GLFW, but its Netwire and Vinyl versions are outdated as of 2016. The combination
  with STM that it suggests is embraced by netwire-input-glfw.


  Usage: Place the executable and the `etc` folder in the same directory. Change to
  that directory in the command line and run the executable.

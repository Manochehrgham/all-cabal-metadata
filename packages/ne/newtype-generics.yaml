description: ! 'Per Conor McBride, the Newtype typeclass represents the packing and
  unpacking of a newtype,

  and allows you to operatate under that newtype with functions such as ala.

  Generics support was added in version 0.4, making this package a full replacement

  for the original newtype package, and a better alternative to newtype-th.'

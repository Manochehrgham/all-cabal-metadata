description: ! 'The package provides the named entity recognition (NER) tool divided
  into a

  back-end library (see the "NLP.Nerf" module) and the front-end tool nerf.

  Using the library you can model and recognize named entities (NEs) which,

  for a particular sentence, take the form of forest with NE category values

  kept in internal nodes and sentence words kept in forest leaves.


  To model NE forests we combine two different techniques. The IOB codec

  is used to translate to and fro between the original, forest representation

  of NEs and the sequence of atomic labels. In other words, it provides two

  isomorphic functions for encoding and decoding between both

  representations. Linear-chain conditional random fields, on the other hand,

  provide the framework for label modelling and tagging.'

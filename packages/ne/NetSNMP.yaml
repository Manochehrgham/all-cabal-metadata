synopsis: Bindings for net-snmp's C API for clients
changelog: ! "0.3.2.1 - 11. April 2016\n        * Fix parsing IPs. Issue #4 (https://github.com/ptek/netsnmp/issues/4)\n\t
  \ In the prevois code, \"0.0.0.0\" converts to \"\\NUL.\\NUL.\\NUL.\\NUL\"\n\t  Thanks
  to lievenm (https://github.com/lievenm) for pointing it out.\n\t* Remove the dependency
  on utf8-string. Using ByteString.Char8 instead\n\t  since the oids we were decoding
  as utf8 before, are number after all\n\t  and should not be in UTF8 range anyway\n\n0.3.2.0
  - 19. June 2015\n        * Make the library compile with GHC 7.10.1\n\n0.3.1.0 -
  19. April 2014\n        * Make the library work on Debian 7 with ByteString 0.9\n\n0.3.0.6\n
  \       * OIDpart type is hacked to work correctly on OS X\n\n0.3.0.5\n        *
  Tied the OIDPart to the correct C Type of the oid.\n          NOTE: This breaks
  the code on the OS X and we don't know why\n                The oid of the SNMP
  Result can not be read correctly\n\n0.3.0.4\n        * Reduced the default number
  of max-repetitions in Bulk PDUs to 30.\n          The previous value caused oversized
  responses on Extreme Network\n          switches.\n\n0.3.0.3\n        * Fixed a
  bug, where instead of 32 bit, the OID part was set to CLong,\n          which became
  64 bit in base 4.5\n\n0.3.*\n        * Switch from Strings to ByteStrings\n\n0.2.*\n
  \       * Implementation includes snmpBulkWalk\n"

description: ! 'Network.Protocol.NetSNMP is a partial binding to the

  library portion of the net-snmp package.  It uses the

  ''single-session api'', which is claimed to be

  thread-safe.  Not all operations are supported yet;

  expanded functionality, and especially if you would

  like to contribute.'

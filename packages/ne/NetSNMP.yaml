synopsis: Bindings for net-snmp's C API for clients
changelog: ! "0.3.1.0 - 19. April 2014\n        * Make the library work on Debian
  7 with ByteString 0.9\n\n0.3.0.6 * OIDpart type is hacked to work correctly on OS
  X\n\n0.3.0.5 * Tied the OIDPart to the correct C Type of the oid.\n          NOTE:
  This breaks the code on the OS X and we don't know why\n                The oid
  of the SNMP Result can not be read correctly\n\n0.3.0.4 * Reduced the default number
  of max-repetitions in Bulk PDUs to 30.\n          The previous value caused oversized
  responses on Extreme Network\n          switches.\n\n0.3.0.3 * Fixed a bug, where
  instead of 32 bit, the OID part was set to CLong,\n          which became 64 bit
  in base 4.5\n\n0.3.*   * Switch from Strings to ByteStrings\n\n0.2.*   * Implementation
  includes snmpBulkWalk\n"

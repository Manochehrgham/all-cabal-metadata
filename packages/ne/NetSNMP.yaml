description: ! 'Network.Protocol.NetSNMP is a partial binding to the

  library portion of the net-snmp package.  It uses the

  ''single-session api'', which is claimed to be

  thread-safe.  Not all operations are supported yet;

  please contact the maintainer if you''re in need of

  expanded functionality, and especially if you would

  like to contribute.'

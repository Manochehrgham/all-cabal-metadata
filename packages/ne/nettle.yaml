description: ! '# haskell-nettle


  This is the source repository for the "nettle" cabal package, which is a safe binding
  to the [nettle](http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/nettle.html) library (tested
  with 3.1.1, might work with 3.0, does NOT WORK with 2.x).


  The binding supports all hash functions, cipher functions, cipher modes and keyed
  hash functions (apart from Poly1305-AES) included in nettle (additionally the AEAD-CCM
  cipher mode is implemented in pure haskell).


  Not included are the PBKDF2 key derivation functions, the public-key algorithms
  (RSA, DSA, elliptic curves, ECDSA), the pseudo-random generators (lagged Fibonacci
  and Yarrow), and the base64/base16 encoding/decoding functions.


  Also not included are the undocumented ASN1, PGP, PKCS1 and "s-expression" functions.


  The haddock generated documentation is available at http://stbuehler.github.io/haskell-nettle/


  The test vectors were extracted from the nettle library and ported to haskell; they
  come from different sources.

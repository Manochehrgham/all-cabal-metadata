description: ! 'A list-like data structure implemented using a nested data type and
  polymorphic

  recursion. It supports O(log(n)) lookup while still having amortized O(1)

  access to the left end of the sequence. Somewhat similar to finger trees,

  but much simpler and more memory efficient; however, modifying the right end

  of the sequence is still slow.'

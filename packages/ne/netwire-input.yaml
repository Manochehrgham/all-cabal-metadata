description: ! 'This package contains a collection of Monad typeclasses that support

  interaction with input devices such as keyboard and mice. Moreover, these

  typeclasses are used to create wires from the netwire package the produce

  mouse and keyboard input values in a reactive way. This package cannot

  be used independently and must be used with another package that provides

  instantiation of these typeclasses such as netwire-input-glfw.'

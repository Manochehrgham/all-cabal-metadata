description: ! 'This library provides simple read-only access to the

  local computer''s networking configuration. It is

  currently capable of getting a list of all the network

  interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC

  addresses.


  network-info has been tested and is known to work on

  Ubuntu 10.10, FreeBSD 9.0, Mac OS X 10.6.4 and Windows

  XP/7. It probably works on other flavours of Linux,

  OS X, FreeBSD and Windows as well.'

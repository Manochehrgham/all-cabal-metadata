description: ! 'Implementation of the

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network-transport

  network-transport> API over ZeroMQ. This provides access to the

  wealth of transports implemented in ZeroMQ, such as in-process,

  inter-process, TCP, TPIC and multicast. Furthermore, this makes it

  possible to encrypt and authenticate clients using ZeroMQ''s security

  mechanisms, and increase throughput using ZeroMQ''s intelligent

  message batching.'

description: ! 'Nested Sampling is a numerical algorithm for approximate Bayesian

  inference. It generates samples from the posterior

  distribution but its main purpose is to estimate the

  evidence P(M|D) of the model conditioned on the observed

  data. More information on Nested Sampling is available

  at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_sampling_algorithm>.


  The original code can be found at

  <http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/sivia/>

  along with documentation at

  <http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/>.

  An example program called lighthouse.hs is included.


  So far, only the simple demonstration file called mininest.c

  has been ported. There is a more sophisticated C library

  available at

  <http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/nest/nest.tar.gz>

  but it has not been ported to Haskell yet.'

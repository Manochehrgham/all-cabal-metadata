description: ! '''wrecker'' is a library for creating HTTP benchmarks. It is designed
  for

  benchmarking a series of HTTP request were the output of previous requests

  are used as inputs to the next request. This is useful for complex API

  profiling situations.

  ''wrecker'' does not provide any mechanism for making HTTP calls. It works

  with any HTTP client that produces a ''HttpException'' during failure (so

  http-client and wreq will work out of the box).

  See the documentation for examples of how to use ''wrecker'' with

  benchmarking scripts.'

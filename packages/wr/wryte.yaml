description: ! "# wryte\n\nPretty-printed source code with semi-automatic indentation\n\n##
  Introduction\n\nWryte provides an API for generating textual source code with pretty\nindentation
  and alignment. To achieve this, it tracks source column position,\nnewlines, and
  current indentation / alignment internally, and provides a\nmonadic API to conveniently
  manage these.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe usual; `cabal install wryte`, or add wryte
  to your stack\nextra-dependencies.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n\n```haskell\nputStrLn .
  runWryte_ defWryteOptions $ do\n  wryteLn \"module Main where\"\n  wryteLn \"\"\n
  \ wryteLn \"main = do\"\n  indented $ do\n    wryteLn \"putStrLn \\\"Hello, world!\\\"\n```\n\nIndentation
  is tracked monadically, such that `indented` acts as a wrapper that\nautomatically
  prepends indentation to each new line. Indentations stack up, so\nyou can safely
  nest them, and they will do the right thing.\n\n\n"

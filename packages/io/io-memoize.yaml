description: ! 'Transform an IO action into a similar IO action

  that performs the original action only once.


  You can choose to perform the original action

  in one of two ways:


  (1) lazily (might never be performed)


  (2) eagerly (concurrently performed)


  Special thanks to shachaf and headprogrammingczar from #haskell irc

  for helping me reason about the behavior of this library.'

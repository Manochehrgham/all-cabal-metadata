description: ! 'After GHC 7.2 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but was

  not yet exposed in Data.IORef.  This package fills that gap until

  such a time as Data.IORef obsoletes it.


  Further, in addition to exposing native Haskell CAS operations, this

  package contains \"mockups\" that imititate the same functionality

  using either atomicModifyIORef and unsafe pointer equality (in

  @Data.CAS.Fake@) or using foreign functions (@Data.CAS.Foreign@).

  These alternatives are useful for debugging.


  Note that the foreign option does not operate on IORefs and so is

  directly interchangeable with `Data.CAS` and `Data.CAS.Fake` only if

  the interface in `Data.CAS.Class` is used.'

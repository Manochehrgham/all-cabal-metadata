description: ! 'This package consists of several modules, that give a

  pure specification of functions in the IO monad:


  * "Test.IOSpec.Fork": a pure specification of

  ''forkIO''.


  * "Test.IOSpec.IORef": a pure specification of most

  functions that create and manipulate on ''IORefs''.


  * "Test.IOSpec.MVar": a pure specification of most

  functions that create and manipulate and ''MVars''.


  * "Test.IOSpec.STM": a pure specification of

  ''atomically'' and the ''STM'' monad.


  * "Test.IOSpec.Teletype": a pure specification of

  ''getChar'', ''putChar'', and several related

  Prelude functions.


  Besides these modules containing the specifications,

  there are a few other important modules:


  * "Test.IOSpec.Types": defines the ''IOSpec'' type and

  several amenities.


  * "Test.IOSpec.VirtualMachine": defines a virtual

  machine on which to execute pure specifications.


  * "Test.IOSpec.Surrogate": a drop-in replacement for

  the other modules. Import this and recompile your

  code once you''ve finished testing and debugging.


  There are several well-documented examples included

  with the source distribution.'

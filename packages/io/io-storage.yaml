description: ! 'This library allows an application to extend the ''global state''

  hidden inside the IO monad with semi-arbitrary data. Data is

  required to be ''Typeable''. The library provides an essentially

  unbounded number of key-value stores indexed by strings, with

  each key within the stores also being a string.'

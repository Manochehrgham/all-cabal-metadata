description: ! 'Ion is a Haskell EDSL for concurrent, realtime, embedded programming.

  It interfaces with the Ivory EDSL, <http://ivorylang.org/>, to perform

  code generation.  It supports similar scheduling functionality to Atom

  (<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom>), and also accomodates

  asynchronous programming with continuation-passing style.

  Be forewarned that Ion is still heavily experimental.  For some

  further explanation, see the write-up at HaskellEmbedded,

  <https://haskellembedded.github.io/posts/2016-09-23-introducing-ion.html>.'

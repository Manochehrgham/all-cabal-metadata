description: ! 'FWGL is a library for interactive 2D and 3D applications and games.
  It provides a purely functional interface for advanced graphics programming, including
  a type safe embedded DSL for GPU programming. You are not required to know or use
  OpenGL directly to work with FWGL, you just need a basic knowledge of what vertex/fragment
  shaders, uniforms and attributes are (if you are going to make a more advanced use
  of it). FWGL is aimed at functional reactive programming (with Yampa), but provides
  a non-reactive interface as well. There are two backends: fwgl-glfw and fwgl-javascript.'

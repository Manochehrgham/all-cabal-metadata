description: ! 'A commandline parsing library, based on getopt. Comes with a

  powerful attribute system. Supports complex interfaces with many

  options and commands, with option & command grouping, with simple

  and convenient API. Even though quite powerful, it strives to keep

  simple things simple. The library uses "System.Console.GetOpt" as

  its backend.


  In comparison to the other commandline handling libraries:


  Compared to cmdargs, cmdlib has a pure attribute system and is

  based on GetOpt for help formatting & argument parsing. Cmdlib may

  also be more extendable due to typeclass design, and can use

  user-supplied types for option arguments.


  Cmdargs >= 0.4 can optionally use a pure attribute system,

  although this is clearly an add-on and the API is a second-class

  citizen in relation to the impure version.


  GetOpt and parseargs both require explicit flag representation, so

  they live a level below cmdlib. GetOpt is in fact used as a

  backend by cmdlib.'

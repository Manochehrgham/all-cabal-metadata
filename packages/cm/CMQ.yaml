description: ! 'CMQ is a lightweight message queue using the UDP protocol as transport
  protocol. It trades guarantees, consistency mechanisms, (shared) state and transactions
  for robustness, scalability and performance. CMQ fares especially well in modern
  Layer 2 switches in data center networks, as well as in the presence of errors.

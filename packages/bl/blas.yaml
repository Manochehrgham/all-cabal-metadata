description: ! 'The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide

  standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations.

  The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the

  Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform

  matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and

  widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality

  linear algebra software, LAPACK for example.

description: ! 'This library provides an implementation of the older

  blaze-builder interface in terms of the new builder that

  shipped with bytestring-0.10.4.0


  This implementation is mostly intended as a bridge to the

  new builder,  so that code that uses the old interface

  can interoperate with code that uses the new

  implementation.   Note that no attempt has been made

  to preserve the old internal modules,  so code that

  has these dependencies cannot use this interface.


  New code should,  for the most part,  use the new

  interface.   However, this module does implement

  a chunked HTTP encoding,  which is not otherwise

  implemented (yet?) with the new builder.'

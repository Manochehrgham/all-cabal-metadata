description: ! 'Blobs is a diagram editor for directed graphs. It is written in

  Haskell, using the platform-independent GUI toolkit wxHaskell. It

  is a community project at a fairly early stage of development - you

  are encouraged to get involved and improve it!


  Blobs is a front-end for drawing and editing graph diagrams. You

  must add your own back-end engine if you want it to do some

  analysis or processing of the graph.'

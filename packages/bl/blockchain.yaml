description: ! "# blockchain\n\nGeneric blockchain implementation in Haskell. Heavily
  inspired by Bitcoin blockchain, but does not fully comply to the Bitcoin blockchain
  spec. Should be suitable for creating arbitrary Bitcoin-like blockchains with in
  various configurations.\n\nBuild\n\n```\n$ stack build\n```\n\nTest\n\n```\n$ stack
  test                          -- run unit tests\n$ ./scripts/test_mining <num-miners>
  \ -- run test mining network\n$ ./scripts/test_stats <file-path>    -- print blockchain
  stats\n```\n\n#### notable differences from Bitcoin blockchain\n\n* Merkle root
  computed with extra leaves at end of tree (compared to extra leaves duplicated in
  bitcoin)\n* Entities serialized as json\n* Blockchain config is encoded in blockchain\n*
  Blocks include a dedicated coinbase transaction field to simplify special case handling\n*
  Block headers include an additional field for coinbase transaction hash\n* A \"transaction
  in\" must declare its previous transaction hash as either a coinbase transaction
  or a normal transaction\n\n## design goals\n\n* Enforce invariants in types whenever
  possible (non-empty transactions, genesis block, coinbase transactions, etc.)\n*
  Make it simple to create blockchains with arbitrary configurations\n* Make construction
  of unverified blockchains easy, but provide assurance any validated blockchain instance
  conforms to expected rules\n* Blocks & transactions are never presumed to be a valid
  part of a blockchain unless present in a validated blockchain\n* Adding new blocks
  to a validated blockchain can assume validity prior parts of the blockchain\n* Inspecting
  unspent transaction outputs of a validated blockchain can assume validity of all
  transactions\n* Blockchain should be readily serializable\n\n## docs\n\nA blockchain
  is a config and a tree of blocks with each node having a potentially infinite set
  of branches. A `Blockchain` also includes a tag to note whether is has been verified
  to meet all the expected conditions -- `Blockchain Validated` or `Blockchain Unvalidated`.\n\n```hs\ndata
  Blockchain a = Blockchain\n    { _config :: BlockchainConfig\n    , _node   :: BlockchainNode\n
  \   }\n\ndata BlockchainNode = BlockchainNode\n    { nodeBlock :: Block\n    , nodeNodes
  :: [BlockchainNode]\n    }\n```\n\nBlockchain construction revolves around three
  basic functions. Note: the `BlockchainNode` constructor is exported, while the top
  level `Blockchain` constructor is not.\n\n```hs\n-- build an unvalidated blockchain
  from a config and node\nconstruct :: BlockchainConfig -> BlockchainNode -> Blockchain
  Unvalidated\n\n-- validate the blockchain\nvalidate :: Blockchain Unvalidated ->
  Either ValidationException (Blockchain Validated)\n\n-- add a block\naddBlock ::
  Block -> Blockchain Validated -> Either BlockException (Blockchain Validated)\n```\n\nFinally,
  blocks are created by mining. This is a process of finding a `Block` with a certain
  shape so that it satisfies the expected difficulty, as defined in the blockchain
  config. Blocks are mined with the coinbase reward going to the provided public key.
  Note: this function may take a long time to finish executing. Most realistic use
  cases should run this in a separate thread that can be canceled.\n\n```hs\nmineBlock
  :: PublicKey -> [Transaction] -> Blockchain Validated -> IO (Either MineBlockException
  Block)\n```\n\n## todo\n\n* Test attempts to double spend address funds -- particularly
  within the same transaction\n* Implement `createTransaction` (currently only `createSimpleTransaction`)\n*
  Function that validates transactions -- outside of create transaction logic\n* Implement
  max transaction count per block\n* Cache block header hash on block (and maybe transactions)
  for more efficient operations\n  * Maybe cache on the blockchain itself, and `validate`
  computes/checks hashes?\n\n## references\n\n* http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/smart_contracts.html\n*

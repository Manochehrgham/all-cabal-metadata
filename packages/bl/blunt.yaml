description: ! 'Blunt is a web front end to the pointfree and pointful libraries.
  While you

  can install and run it locally, there''s no real reason to prefer it over

  the @pointfree@ and @pointful@ executables. Instead, use the hosted

  version at <https://blunt.herokuapp.com blunt.herokuapp.com>.'

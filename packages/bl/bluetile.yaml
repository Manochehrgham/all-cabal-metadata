description: ! 'Bluetile is a tiling window manager for Linux, designed to integrate

  with the GNOME desktop environment. It provides both a traditional,

  stacking layout mode as well as tiling layouts where windows are

  arranged to use the entire screen without overlapping. Bluetile tries

  to make the tiling paradigm easily accessible to users coming from

  traditional window managers by drawing on known conventions and

  providing both mouse and keyboard access for all features.'

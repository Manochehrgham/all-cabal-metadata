description: ! 'A /priority search queue/ efficiently supports the

  opperations of both a search tree and a priority queue. A

  ''Binding'' is a product of a key and a priority.  Bindings

  can be inserted, deleted, modified and queried in

  logarithmic time, and the binding with the least priority

  can be retrieved in constant time.  A queue can be built

  from a list of bindings, sorted by keys, in linear time.'

  `psi`/`ψ` is just another custom Haskell prelude. It is inspired by

  Ambiata''s [p](https://github.com/ambiata/p) and has the same focus on

  promoting use of safe constructs and avoidance of partial functions,

  but differs in approach. Most significantly, `ψ` follows the [Haskell

  package versioning

  policy](https://wiki.haskell.org/Package_versioning_policy) and is

  intended for release on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/).'

description: ! '''RDF for Haskell'' is a library for working with RDF in Haskell.

  At present it includes parsers and serializers for RDF in the N-Triples

  and Turtle, and parsing support for RDF/XML. It provides abilities such as querying

  for triples  containing a particular subject, predicate, or object, or

  selecting triples that satisfy an arbitrary predicate function.'

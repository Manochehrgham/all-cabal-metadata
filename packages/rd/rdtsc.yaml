description: ! 'This module provides the function ''rdtsc'' for accessing

  the ''rdtsc'' machine register on modern IA-32 processors.  This is

  a 64-bit counter which counts the number of processor cycles since

  the machine has been powered up.  Using this instruction, you can

  make very precise time measurements which are independent of the

  actual CPU frequency.  But note that you can get strange results

  sometimes on a superscalar processor.


  Also note that the Haskell foreign function interface imposes some

  additional overheads.  On my machine, it takes about 950 cycles to

  call this function twice and to compute the difference, whereas in

  C the overhead is only about 88 cycles.'

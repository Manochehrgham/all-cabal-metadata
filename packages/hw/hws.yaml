description: ! 'The original Haskell Web Server, as described in the

  paper "Developing a high-performance web server in

  Concurrent Haskell" (JFP 12(4+5):359--374, July 2002).

  I''m making the package available for archaeological and

  illustrative reasons; while this certainly can be used to

  serve simple static content, there are other much more

  fully-featured web servers and frameworks on Hackage.'

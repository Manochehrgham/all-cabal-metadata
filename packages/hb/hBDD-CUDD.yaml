description: ! "CUDD lacks an install target and a configure script, and so needs
  to be\nsetup by hand for your particular system. Examine:\n\n\t<hbdd toplevel>/cudd-2.4.1/Makefile\n\nand
  adjust the compiler flags for your system. The defaults work fine\non Debian GNU/Linux
  x86 for me. Note it does not build a shared\nlibrary and so GHCi does not work.\n\nI
  use the one from Macports under OS X.\n\nThe create-cudd-so.sh script creates a
  shared library that GHCi can\nuse from the CUDD static libraries.\n"

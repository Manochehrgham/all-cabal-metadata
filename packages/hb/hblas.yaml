description: ! 'User friendly, simple bindings to BLAS and Lapack. Easy to extend
  and use.


  HBLAS assumes you have BLAS and LAPACK installed. Users on OSX already

  have a BLAS and LAPACK installed for them. Users on LINUX and similar

  platforms will need to do the system equivalent of @sudo apt-get install libblas
  liblapack@.


  HBLAS  is not intended to be a library for end user array operations,

  but rather an easy adaptor for calling BLAS and LAPACK routines in their

  full generality from your end-user haskell linear algebra / array library

  of choice.


  HBLAS roughly mirrors the naming conventions and datatype names of  the standard

  BLAS and LAPACK libraries. Those of you who are familiar with these conventions

  and moderately comfortable with haskell will feel right at home.


  If you are not familiar with the the operations and conventions of BLAS and

  Lapack, please read the

  <https://software.intel.com/sites/products/documentation/hpc/mkl/mklman/index.htm
  Intel MKL BLAS and LAPACK documention>,

  you''ll learn a lot about what BLAS and LAPACK can do.


  HBLAS doesn''t provide every BLAS and LAPACK operation currently, but

  is designed so that adding support for new operations is quite easy!'

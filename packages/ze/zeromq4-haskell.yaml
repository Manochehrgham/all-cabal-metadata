description: ! 'The 0MQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which extends

  the standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided

  by specialised messaging middleware products.


  0MQ sockets provide an abstraction of asynchronous message queues,

  multiple messaging patterns, message filtering (subscriptions),

  seamless access to multiple transport protocols and more.


  This library provides the Haskell language binding to 0MQ >= 4.x'

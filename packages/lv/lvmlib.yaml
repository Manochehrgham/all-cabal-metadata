description: ! 'The Lazy Virtual Machine (LVM) defines a portable instruction set
  and file

  format. It is specifically designed to execute languages with non-strict (or

  lazy) semantics. This cabal package defines the core assembler (coreasm) for

  compiling core programs into LVM instructions and a library. The LVM is used

  as a backend for the Helium compiler. At the moment, one LVM runtime

  implementation is available (written in C). More information about LVM can be

  found in Chapter 6 of Daan Leijen''s PhD Thesis, The Lambda Abroad.'

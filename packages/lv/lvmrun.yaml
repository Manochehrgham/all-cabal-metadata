description: ! 'The Lazy Virtual Machine (LVM) defines a portable instruction set
  and file

  format. It is specifically designed to execute languages with non-strict (or

  lazy) semantics. This cabal package defines an LVM runtime written in C.

  The core assembler (coreasm) for compiling core programs into LVM instructions

  and a library is defined in the lvmlib cabal package. The LVM is used

  as a backend for the Helium compiler. More information about LVM can be

  found in Chapter 6 of Daan Leijen''s PhD Thesis, The Lambda Abroad.

  We use the Make build-type here. The dependencies are provided in the Cabal

  file, and their generation is not handled by Cabal. Instead, if you change

  dependencies please run `make depend''. This occurs extremely rarely, though,

  because we do not plan to evolve lvmrun.

  Fornothing.hs is only there to please Cabal.'

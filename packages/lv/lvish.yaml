description: ! '

  A programming model based on monotonically-growing concurrent data structures.


  As a starting point, look at the main module, "Control.LVish", as well as one of
  these papers:


  * FHPC 2013: /LVars: lattice-based data structures for deterministic parallelism/
  (<http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2502326>).


  * POPL 2014: /Freeze after writing: quasi-deterministic parallel programming with
  LVars/ (<http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~lkuper/papers/2013-lvish-draft.pdf>).


  * PLDI 2014: /Taming the Parallel Effect Zoo: Extensible Deterministic Parallelism
  with LVish/ (<http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~rrnewton/papers/effectzoo-draft.pdf>).


  If the haddocks are not building, here is a mirror:

  Change Log:


  * 1.0.0.6 - tighten up dependencies; remove unused flags; very minor doc fixes.


  * 1.1.2  - many bugfixes, plus a new logging infrastructure, and verification of
  finite lattices


  * 1.1.4 - GHC 7.8.3 compatibility.'

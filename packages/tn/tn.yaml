description: ! "# tn\n\nThis is a command-line program for keeping your own journals,
  written in\n[Haskell][hs] and licensed under the [ISC license][iscl]. You can find
  a\ncopy of the ISC licensein the [LICENSE file][license-file]\n\n## History\n\nI've
  been trying on and off to write this program since 2014, but have\nnever gotten
  to the point where I've actually had a usable\nprogram. Hence, why we're on version
  4.0, and I still don't have a\nusable version yet. Each new major version has been
  a complete rewrite\nbecause the previous version was a disaster.\n\ntn is licensed
  as such because I originally wanted to use it as a tool\nto record the food I was
  eating. The natural name would be `fj`, for\n\"food journal\". However, I use the
  [Colemak keyboard layout][2], and\ntyping `fj` is somewhat awkward. Moreover, in
  2014, I had only begun\nusing the Colemak layout. Hitting the key immediately under
  left index\nfinger, followed by the key under the right index finder yielded the\nsequence
  `tn` in Colemak.\n\n## Specification\n\n*   `tn \"some string\"` records the journal
  entry to\n    `~/.local/share/tn/journal.yml` with the time.\n\n    * adding `--stdout`
  prints the output to stdout\n    * adding `-` takes the input from stdin\n    *
  adding `--stdin` takes the input from stdin\n  \n## Installing\n\nThe version on
  Hackage is out of date, and also really terrible, so\ndon't try to `cabal install
  tn` just yet. You'll need [git][git-install]\nand [The Haskell Stack][hs-stack].\n\n
  \   git clone https://github.com/pharpend/tn.git\n    cd tn\n    stack setup\n    stack
  build\n\nI welcome any contributions anyone wants to make. If you find a bug or
  a\nfeature request, use the [GitHub bug tracker][issues]. If you want to\ncontribute,
  use the normal method of contributing to projects on GitHub.\n\n## Usage\n\nThere
  is no usage yet! Check back later!\n\n## Contacting me\n\nYou can contact me at
  `peter@harpending.org`, or `pharpend` on FreeNode.\n\n[colemak]: http://colemak.com/\n[git]:

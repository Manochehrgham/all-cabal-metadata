description: ! 'This is subset of Parsec.


  Parsec 3 provides features which Parsec 2 does not provide:

  - Applicative style

  - ByteString as input


  But Haskell Platform includes Parsec 2, not Parsec 3. Installing

  Parsec 3 to Haskell Platform environment makes it mess. So, I have

  implemented this.

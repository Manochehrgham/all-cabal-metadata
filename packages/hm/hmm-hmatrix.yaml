description: ! 'Hidden Markov Models implemented using HMatrix data types and operations.

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_Model>


  It implements:


  * generation of samples of emission sequences,


  * computation of the likelihood of an observed sequence of emissions,


  * construction of most likely state sequence

  that produces an observed sequence of emissions,


  * supervised and unsupervised training of the model by Baum-Welch algorithm.


  It supports any kind of emission distribution,

  where discrete and multivariate Gaussian distributions

  are implemented as examples.


  For an introduction please refer to the examples:


  * "Math.HiddenMarkovModel.Example.TrafficLight"


  * "Math.HiddenMarkovModel.Example.SineWave"


  * "Math.HiddenMarkovModel.Example.Circle"


  An alternative package without foreign calls is @hmm@.'

description: ! "# Multi Expression Programming\n\nYou say, Haskell has not enough
  machine learning libraries?\n\nHere is yet another one!\n\n## History\n\nThere exist
  many other Genetic Algorithm (GA) Haskell packages.\nPersonally I have used\n[simple
  genetic algorithm](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/moo),\n[GA](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/moo),\nand
  [moo](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/moo) for quite a long time.\nThe last package
  was the most preferred, but the other two are\nalso great.\n\nHowever, when I came
  up with this\n[MEP paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.5.4352&rep=rep1&type=pdf),\nto
  my surprise there was no MEP realization in Haskell.\nSoon I realized that existing
  GA packages are limited,\nand it would be more efficient to implement MEP from scratch.\n\nThat
  is how this package was started. I also wish to say thank you\nto the authors of
  the [moo](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/moo) \nGA library, which inspired the
  present \n[hmep](http://github.com/masterdezign/hmep) package.\n\n## About MEP\n\nMulti
  Expression Programming is a genetic programming variant encoding multiple\nsolutions
  in the same chromosome. A chromosome is a computer program.\nEach gene is featuring
  [code reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse).\nFor more details, please
  check http://mepx.org/papers.html and\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_expression_programming.\n"

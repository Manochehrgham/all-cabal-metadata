description: ! 'A thin, lightweight wrapper over hmatrix to support

  static checking of matrix and vector sizes (for instance,

  addition of different-sized vectors will be disallowed

  at compile-time).


  Objects whose sizes are not statically known are given

  the special size ''Unknown'', which allows a syntactically

  cheap way to step down to the statically unchecked system

  of hmatrix. This is cheap in comparison to representing

  unknown sizes with exisential types, which forces pervasive

  continuation passing style.


  WARNING: when using the QuasiQuoting in this package,

  be aware of infix expressions. See the note in

  "Data.Packed.Static.Syntax" for details.'

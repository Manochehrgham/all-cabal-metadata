description: ! 'Haskell binding to the MPFR library. This version is compatible

  with MPFR 2.4.* and later and will not work with previous releases

  of the MPFR library.


  /Since MPFR uses GMP, this library features infrequent but serious errors/

  /with a ghc that has been compiled with the default integer-gmp./

  /When using ghc, it is recommended to use one compiled with a modified integer-gmp,/

  /as described at/


  <http://code.google.com/p/hmpfr/wiki/GHCWithRenamedGMP>


  /or/

  /with integer-simple, as described at/


  <http://code.google.com/p/hmpfr/wiki/GHCWithoutGMP>


  /There is a hope that at some point future versions of ghc will not need any modification
  for/

  /hmpfr to work with them correctly./


  The library includes both a pure and a mutable interface.

  The mutable interface should have a lot less overhead

  than the pure one.


  Some simple examples of usage can be found in demo/Demo.hs.'

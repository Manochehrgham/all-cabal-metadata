description: ! 'Partial implementation of the MIDI 1.0 standard to communicate

  with physical or virtual MIDI devices, eg. MIDI keyboards.

  Supported operating systems are Mac OS X and Windows.

  See also the alsa-midi library for similar

  function under Linux. Please note that there was no effort made (yet) to

  be compatible with the other existing Haskell MIDI libraries.'

description: ! 'Clone of Plan9''s mk command, said to have \"improved on make by

  removing all the vowels from the name\". Most features of mk

  are implemented, including basic meta-rules support and

  concurrent execution of jobs.


  The library exports a generic dependency graph traversal that

  can be used independently of the rest.


  The documentation is embedded in the literate Haskell source.


  /Note:/ the library portion is released to the /public domain/.

  Those source files that are not part of the library

  are released under GPLv3 or later.'

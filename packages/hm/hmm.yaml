description: Data.HMM is a library for using Hidden Markov Models with Haskell.  Commonly
  used algoriths (i.e. the forward and backwards algorithms, Viterbi, and Baum-Welch)
  are implemented.  The best way to learn to use it is to visit the tutorial at http:\/\/izbicki.me\/blog\/using-hmms-in-haskell-for-bioinformatics.  The
  tutorial also includes performance benchmarks that you should be aware of.

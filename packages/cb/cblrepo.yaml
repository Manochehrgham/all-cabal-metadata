description: ! 'Helper tool for people maintaining a set of CABAL packages for their

  distribution. It maintains a database of packages and verifies dependencies

  of the entire set as packages are added or updated. It also makes it trivial

  to track packages as new versions are released on Hackage.

  It can also be used to build source packages for the Arch Linux

  distribution.'

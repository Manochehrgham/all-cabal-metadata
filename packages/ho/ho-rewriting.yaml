description: ! "This package gives a generic implementation of higher-order rewriting.
  The main idea is to use techniques from embedded domain-specific languages to offer
  an interface which is both safe and syntactically appealing.\n\nSome examples are
  found in the [examples directory](examples). For more information, see \"Lightweight
  Higher-Order Rewriting in Haskell\":\n\n  * [Paper](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~emax/documents/axelsson2015lightweight.pdf)\n

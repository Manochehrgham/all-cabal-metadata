description: ! 'The ''HoleyMonoid'' allows building monoidal values of which certain
  components are to be filled in later. For example:


  > > let holey :: (Show a, Show b) => HoleyMonoid String r (a -> b -> r)

  >       holey = now "x = " . later show . now ", y = " . later show

  >

  > > run holey 3 5

  > "x = 3, y = 5"'

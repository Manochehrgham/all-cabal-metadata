description: ! 'hothasktags generates ctags files for Haskell, with knowledge of import
  lists

  and qualified imports.  It provides a smart go-to-definition for Vim, that almost

  always gets it right in the presence of multiple names from different modules.


  You will want to configure Vim to allow dots in keywords, because hothasktags

  generates tags for qualified names.  You can do this with:


  > set iskeyword=a-z,A-Z,_,.,39


  (The 39 is for the prime character)


  Usage is easy, just give hothasktags the names of all the haskell sources you

  want to index and redirect into a tags file.  For example:


  > find . | egrep ''\.hs$'' | xargs hothasktags > tags


  will index all the hs files under the current directory.


  hothasktags does not work with the emacs tag file format.  Sorry.'

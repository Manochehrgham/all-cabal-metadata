synopsis: Lighweight algorithmic debugging based on observing intermediate values
  and the cost centre stack.
changelog: ! "0.2.1 Maarten Faddegon 1 May 2015\n\n  * Small changes to make Hoed
  work with GHC 7.10\n\n0.2.0 Maarten Faddegon 12 Feb 2015\n\n  * A threepenny-gui
  algorithmic debugger.\n  * Construction of computation trees with just local annotations.
  Existing algorithmic debuggers for Haskell require a transformation of all modules
  in a program, even libraries that the user does not want to debug and which may
  use language features not supported by the debugger. This is a pity, because a promising
  approach to debugging is therefore not applicable to many real-world programs. We
  use the cost centre stack from the Glasgow Haskell Compiler profiling environment
  together with runtime value observations to collect enough information for algorithmic
  debugging.\n\n\n0.1.0.1 Maarten Faddegon 24 May 2014\n\n  * A tracer library based
  on Andy Gills HOOD v0.2. Allows to observe intermediate values. How values are observed
  can be derived with the Generic Deriving Mechanism, or generated with Template Haskell.

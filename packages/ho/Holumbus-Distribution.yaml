description: ! 'Holumbus-Distribution offers distributed data structures like Chan,
  MVar or functions.

  These datatype can be used between different programs on different computers to
  exchange

  data. With the help of this library it is possible to build Erlang-Style mailboxes
  for an

  easy implementation of distributed systems in Haskell.'

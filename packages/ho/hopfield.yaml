description: ! 'Attractor Neural Networks for Modelling Associative Memory


  Report: <https://github.com/imperialhopfield/hopfield/raw/master/report/report.pdf>


  A third year group project at Imperial College London,

  supervised by Prof. Abbas Edalat.


  This projects implements:


  * Hopfield Networks


  * Clusters and Super Attractors


  * The Restricted Boltzmann Machine


  * A Boltzmann Machine for classification


  and comes with a range of experiments to evaluate their properties.'

description: ! 'Initial version with very limited bindings to OpenCV 2.0. (See: <http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Welcome>)


  For a functional interface to this library, see the package "cv-combinators".


  Online module documentation, if not build below, can be found at <http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~noamle/>.


  /Installation/


  You must install OpenCV (development packages) prior to installing this package.
  Currently only tested on Ubuntu Linux, but should work on most linux distributions.
  For OpenCV installation on other *nix platforms, see <http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.0/>


  On /Ubuntu/ systems, the appropriate version of OpenCV can be installed by:


  > sudo apt-get install libcv-dev libhighgui-dev libcvaux-dev


  You should then have libcv4 and libhighgui4 installed automatically too.

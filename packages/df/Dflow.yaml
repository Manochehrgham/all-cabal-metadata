description: ! 'This library provides Real Time Stream Processors (RTSPs). An RTSP

  transforms an input event stream into an output event stream. The output

  events occur asynchronously with input events. RTSPs can be composed into

  pipelines or executed in parallel and their outputs merged. A Real Time

  Action (RTA) monad is provided for creating new primitive RTSPs.'

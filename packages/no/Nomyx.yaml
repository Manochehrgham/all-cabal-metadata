description: ! 'A Nomic game in Haskell, with a dedicated language to create new rules.


  Nomyx is a fabulous and strange game where you have the right to change the rules
  in the middle of the game!

  Indeed, changing the rules is the goal of the game. Changing a rule is considered
  as a move. Of course even that could be changed!'

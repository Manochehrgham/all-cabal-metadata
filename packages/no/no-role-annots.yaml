description: ! 'This package is intended to ease the transition from GHC 7.6.3- to
  GHC 7.8+

  by providing a backward-compatible role annotation syntax. The module

  Language.Haskell.RoleAnnots exports backward-compatible declarations

  usable to assign stricter roles to declarations. Proper role annotations

  are preferred, but these work, too.

  The module Language.Haskell.RoleAnnots.Check provides a way to check

  that a datatype has a set of desired roles. This might be suitable for

  use in a testsuite.

  See the module documentation for details.

  Note that this package works only with GHC 7.4 and up, because it depends

  on the -XPolyKinds extension. If you need backward compatibility before

  7.4, then please look at the source code and adapt the definitions to the

  kinds of the variables in your program.'

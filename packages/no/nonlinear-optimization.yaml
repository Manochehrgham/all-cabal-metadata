description: ! 'This library implements numerical algorithms to optimize

  nonlinear functions.  Optimization means that we try to find

  a minimum of the function.  Currently all algorithms

  guarantee only that local minima will be found, not global

  ones.


  Almost any continuosly differentiable function @f : R^n -> R@

  may be optimized by this library.  Any further restrictions

  are listed in the modules that need them.


  We use the @vector@ package to represent vectors and

  matrices, although it would be possible to use something like

  @hmatrix@ easily.


  Currently only CG_DESCENT method is implemented.'

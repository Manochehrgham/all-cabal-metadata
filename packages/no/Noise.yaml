description: ! '

  A Haskell coherent noise generator roughly based on libnoise.

  For more information on libnoise, please check: <http://libnoise.sourceforge.net>

  The noise modules were extensively profiled and benchmarked,

  the slower pure functions were rewritten in C.

  The main objective of this packer is to provide a simple interface

  to compose noise modules.

  This is a 3D noise package, to get a value you need to specify a

  triple:


  > getValue myComposition (-0.1, -0.5, 0.76)


  For more information please read the documentation of each module

  bellow.


  Special thanks to Csaba Hruska for the patches and testing'

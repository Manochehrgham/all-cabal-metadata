description: ! 'This package provides a framework for working with genetic

  algorithms. A genetic algorithm is an evolutionary technique,

  inspired by biological evolution, to evolve entities that perform

  as good as possible in terms of a predefined criterion (the scoring

  function). Note: lower scores are assumed to indicate better entities.

  The GA module provides a type class for defining entities and the

  functions that are required by the genetic algorithm.

  Checkpointing in between generations is available, as is automatic

  restoring from the last available checkpoint.'

description: ! 'A library for parsing Subversion dump files.  The objective is to
  convert a

  dump file into a series of data structures representing that same

  information.  It uses `Data.ByteString.Lazy` to reading the file, and

  `Data.Text` to represent text fields which may contain Unicode characters.'

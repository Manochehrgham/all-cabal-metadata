description: ! 'A BSON Document is an untyped (dynamically type-checked) record.

  I.e. it is a list of name-value pairs, where a Value is a single

  sum type with constructors for basic types (Bool, Int, Float,

  String, and Time), compound types (List, and (embedded) Document),

  and special types (Binary, Javascript, ObjectId, RegEx, and a few

  others).

  A BSON Document is serialized to a standard binary encoding

  defined at <http://bsonspec.org>. This implements version 1 of

  that spec.'

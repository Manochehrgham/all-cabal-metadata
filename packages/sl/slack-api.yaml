description: ! 'This library provides bindings to the <https://api.slack.com/rtm Slack
  Real Time Messaging API>.

  Users should find it easy to program their own Slack bots using the functionality
  found in `Web.Slack`.

  The bindings are very nearly complete. Library authors

  looking to build bindings to the <https://api.slack.com/web Slack Web API> may

  find the `FromJSON` instances located in `Web.Slack.Types`

  useful.

  Please note that the interface provided by this package is not yet stable. There
  are a number of unresolved

  internal inconsistencies which have yet to be resolved by Slack HQ.'

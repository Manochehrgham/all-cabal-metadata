  Jan 2015\n---\n\n# NAME\n\nsloane - a command line interface to Sloane's\nOn-Line
  Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences <http://oeis.org>\n\n# SYNOPSIS\n\nsloane [-a|--all]
  [-k KEYS] [-n N] [--url] [--local] TERMS...\n\nsloane -A NUMBER\n\nsloane --filter
  [--invert]\n\nsloane --transform NAME\n\nsloane (--list-transforms | --update |
  --version | --help)\n\n# DESCRIPTION\n\nThe `sloane` command searches Sloane's On-Line
  Encyclopedia of Integer\nSequences (OEIS). The search terms are typically the leading
  term of a\nsequence. For example,\n\n    sloane 1,1,2,5,15,52,203,877,4140\n\nreturns
  entry A000110 (Bell numbers), and four more entries.  One can\nalso search by sequence
  id (A-number), or even search for arbitrary\nwords. See the **EXAMPLES** section.\n\nAlternatively,
  using the `--local` option, the search can be done\nlocally against a downloaded
  local database of known sequences. This\nmode works by \"grepping\" for the query
  in the sequence field.\n\nTo check a large number of sequences one can use `--filter`.
  \ When this\noption is set, `sloane` reads the standard input line-by-line, if the\nsequence
  read is in the local database, then it is returned to the\nstandard output; if not,
  it is ignored. This way one can quickly filter\nout the sequences from the input
  that are in the local database. In\nother words, assuming that *FILE* contains one
  sequence per line,\n\n    sloane --filter <FILE\n\nreturns the subset of the sequences
  in *FILE* that are in the local\ndatabase. To also look-up the names of those sequences
  one could, for\ninstance, run\n\n    sloane --filter <FILE | xargs -L1 --verbose
  sloane --local\n\nSloane normally crops long lines to fit the widths of the terminal.
  If\nthis is unwanted, pipe the output through cat or less:\n\n    sloane -a id:A000110
  | less -R\n\n# OPTIONS\n\n-a, --all\n:   Print all fields\n\n-k *KEYS*\n:   Keys
  of fields to print (default: SN)\n\n-n *N*\n:   Fetch at most this many entries
  (default: 5)\n\n--url\n:   Print URLs of found entries (but nothing else)\n\n--local\n:
  \  Grep for a sequence in the local database.\n\n-A *NUMBER*\n:   Fetch the sequence
  with this number from the local database. Prints\n    the sequence, but nothing
  else, to sdout.\n\n--filter\n:   Read sequences from stdin and return those that
  are in the local\n    database.\n\n--invert\n:   Return sequences *not* in the database.
  This option has no effect\n    unless `--filter` is also set.\n\n--transform *NAME*\n:
  \  Apply the named transform to the input sequence. If the resulting\n    sequence
  is integral print it to stdout; else print nothing.\n    Most of the transforms
  and their names are taken from\n    <https://oeis.org/transforms.txt>.\n\n--list-transforms\n:
  \  List the names of all transforms.\n\n--update\n:   Update the local database.\n\n--version\n:
  \  Print version information.\n\n--help\n:   Briefly describe the available options.\n\n#
  EXAMPLES\n\nThe most common search is for entries matching a sequence of consecutive
  terms:\n\n    sloane 1,3,19,183,2371,38703\n\nAt the time of writing this particular
  query would return\n\n    S A006531 1,1,3,19,183,2371,38703,763099,17648823,468603091,14050842303,\n
  \   N A006531 Semiorders on n elements.\n\nAs this illustrates, the default is to
  return just the sequence (S) and\nthe name (N) fields. To override the default one
  can use the keys\noption. For instance, the following search shows the sequence,
  name,\ncomments, and formula fields of the sequence whose A-number is A006531:\n\n
  \   sloane -k SNCF id:A006531\n\nThe next example returns at most 3 results of a
  free text search:\n\n    sloane -n 3 \"(2+2)-free posets\"\n\nTo view the full entries
  of these 3 results in a browser (e.g., Firefox)\none can use the url option:\n\n
  \   firefox `sloane --url -n 3 \"(2+2)-free posets\"`\n\nTo retrieve sequence A022493
  from the local database use the `-A` option:\n\n    sloane -A022493\n\nIn the final
  example the local database is used to filter out sequences\nfrom the standard input
  that are in OEIS:\n\n    sloane --filter <<END\n    1,2,3,6,11,23,47,106,235           #
  Comma separated integers\n    1 2 444 90 120                     # Space separated
  integers\n    '(3 9 27 88 123)                   # S-expression\n    [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37]
  \ # Haskell list\n    [1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21]         # O'Caml list\n    {1,
  -1, 2, -6, 24, -120, 720}      # Mathematica list\n    END\n\nThe '#' character
  and any text after it is ignored by sloane. Note also\nthat sloane is quite liberal
  in the formatting of sequences it accepts.\n\n# KEYS\n\nThese are the keys used

description: ! 'IEEE 754 (Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic) Utilities.


  This package is a simple adaptation of ieee-utils, but compilable by ghc >= 7.

  Unfortunately, MK had no response from the mainainer of ieee-utils, despite trying

  to make contact for over 2 years.  MK plans to deprecate this package when I find
  out that

  ieee-utils is fixed or deprecated.'

description: ! 'YampaSynth is a software synthesizer implemented in Yampa, domain
  specific language embedded in Haskell. It contains a little framework of sound generating
  and sound shaping modules (e.g. oscillator, amplifier, mixer, envelope generator,
  filter, etc.) and example applications:


  * "yampasynth-wav" is an application which synthesizes a MIDI music and writes result
  into a WAVE audio file.


  * "yampasynth-openal" is an application which synthesizes a MIDI music and sends
  audio data in real-time to a sound card. We use Haskell binding of OpenAL library
  as an interface to audio hardware.


  * "yampasynth-gtk" is an application with the simple graphical user interface which
  allows you to play a music with various instruments in real-time using the keyboard
  of your computer. We use Haskell binding of GTK library for GUI programming and
  Haskell binding of OpenAL library as an interface to audio hardware.


  Software synthesizer uses the MIDI standard as a music description and the SoundFont
  standard as an instrument description.


  Implementation is based on the paper "Switched-on Yampa: Declarative Programming
  of Modular Synthesizers", by George Giorgidze and Henrik Nilsson (<http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~ggg/publications/padl2008.pdf>),
  In Proceedings of 10th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative
  Languages, San Francisco, CA, USA, January 7-8, 2008.


  This is mainly a proof of concept, but already useful to some extent.'

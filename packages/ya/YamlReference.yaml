description: ! 'This package contains \"the\" reference YAML syntax parser

  ("Text.Yaml.Reference"), generated directly from the YAML

  specifications, as well as sample program (@yaml2yeast@)

  that allows accessing it from the command line, converting

  YAML files to YEAST tokens. This is intended to be more of

  an \"executable specification\" for YAML rather than an

  actual basis for YAML tool chains. That said, it is

  possible to build interesting tools on top of it, such as

  the @yeast2html@ YAML syntax visualizer (contained in this

  package), pretty printers, etc. This is a streaming parser

  that will \"immediately\" begin to generate output.

  Updated to be compatible with the final Apr 1, 2009 YAML

  1.2 spec.'

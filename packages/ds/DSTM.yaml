description: ! 'The DSTM package consists of the DSTM library, a name server application,
  and

  three sample distributed programs using the library. DSTM is a framework

  enabling the use of the STM interface, known from concurrent programming, to be

  used for distributed Haskell applications as well. Provided are a simple Dining

  Philosophers, a Chat, and a soft real-time Bomberman game application.


  Distributed communication is transparent to the application programmer. The

  application designer uses a very simple nameserver mechanism to set up the

  system. The DSTM library includes the management of unavailable process nodes

  and provides the application with abstract error information thus facilitating

  the implementation of robust distributed application programs.


  For usage please look into the included file: DSTMManual.pdf, also available at

  http:\/\/www.informatik.uni-kiel.de\/prog\/mitarbeiter\/frank-kupke\/.


  Changes from last version:


  * documentation available online


  * fixed typos in Chat example


  * set debug flags to no debug output'

description: ! 'Difference strings: a data structure for O(1) append on strings. Note
  that a

  @DString@ is just a newtype wrapper around a @DList Char@. The reason we need a

  new type instead of just a type synonym is that we can have an @instance

  IsString DString@ without using language extensions (@TypeSynonymInstances@ or

  @FlexibleInstances@) so we can write overloaded string literals of type @DString@.'

description: ! 'A monad transformer that mimics the State Monad Transformer from the

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers transformers> package,

  but dropping the values. In those cases that you want to use the State

  Monad but you only care about effects and how the state changes, use

  this library to earn a plus of efficiency.'

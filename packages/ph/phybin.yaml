description: ! 'This package provides a libary and executable for dealing with Newick
  tree files.


  It can do simple binning of identical trees or more complex clustering based on

  an all-to-all Robinson-Foulds distance matrix.


  phybin produces output files that characterize the size and contents of each bin
  or cluster (including

  generating GraphViz-based visual representations of the tree topologies).'

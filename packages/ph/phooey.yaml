description: ! 'Phooey is a library for functional UIs, providing three different

  functional interfaces: Monad, Applicative, and Arrow.  See the

  correspondingly named modules in the list below.  The other modules are

  exposed for extensibility.


  Try out the examples in @src\/Examples\/@.


  Because this library uses reactive, compile apps with @-threaded@.

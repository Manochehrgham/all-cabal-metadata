description: ! 'This is a thread-safe logging framework.  It logs to memory, with
  various

  options for serializing log messages out to a file or handle.  A verbosity

  level controls the quantity of log messages.

  For debugging, this logging framework can do double-duty by controlling the

  interleaving of threads which are producing log messages, for the purpose of

  fuzz-testing concurrent interleavings.  This is accomplished by blocking the

  threads at the point of each logging message, and controlling the order in

  which threads (sequentially) unblock.'

description: ! 'This package provides an implementation of a skip list in STM.

  A skip list is a probabilistic data structure with dictionary

  operations and support for efficient range-queries (similarly to /Data.Map/). In
  contrast

  to tree data structures, a skip list does not need any rebalancing, which makes
  it particularly

  suitable for concurrent programming. See: William Pugh. Skip Lists: A

  Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Trees.

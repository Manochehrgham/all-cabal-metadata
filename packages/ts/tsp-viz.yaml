description: ! 'Real time TSP tour visualization using Gloss.

  This program is used as a standalone binary and exposes an interface which

  communicates over a stream, such as stdout or a file handle.

  It supports a single set vertices with multiple tours rendered and updated

  during execution, with overlapping edges being bended appropriately.

  Currently there is only a C++ interface available in the git repository.'

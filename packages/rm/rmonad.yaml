description: ! 'A library for restricted monads based on associated datatypes.

  This allows datatypes such as Set to be made into monads.

  Users can either use the NoImplicitPrelude extension and use

  Control.RMonad directly, or use Control.RMonad.AsMonad with

  the embed and unEmbed combinators to use the normal Prelude

  monad operations.'

description: ! 'GuiTV is a very small library that extends the TV (tangible value)

  framework with graphical user interfaces, using Phooey.  (See

  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV> and

  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Phooey>.)  The functionality was part of

  the TV package up to version 0.1.1.  I moved it out to eliminate the

  dependency of core TV on Phooey and hence on wxHaskell, as the latter

  can be difficult to install.


  Try out the examples in @src\/Examples.hs@.


  For more information, including examples, please see the project wiki

  This page and the module documentation pages have links to colorized

  source code and to wiki pages where you can read and contribute /user

description: ! 'A tutorial program for the Egison programming language.

  Egison is the programming langugage that realized non-linear pattern-matching against
  unfree data types.

  With Egison, we can represent pattern-matching with unfree data types intuitively,
  especially for collection data, such as lists, multisets, sets.

  Please try Egison with this tutorial program!'

description: ! 'An extensible library of user interface widgets for composing and

  laying out Vty user interfaces.  This library provides a collection

  of widgets for building and composing interactive,

  event-driven terminal interfaces.  This library is intended to make

  non-trivial user interfaces easy to express and modify without

  having to worry about terminal size.


  Be sure to check out the user manual for the version you''re using

  at: <http://jtdaugherty.github.com/vty-ui/>

  to see some of the things the library can do!'

description: ! 'The VTE library inserts terminal capability strings into a trie, and
  then

  uses it to determine if data received from a pseudo-terminal is a control

  sequence or just random data. The sample program "interpret" illustrates

  more or less what the widget sees after it filters incoming data.'

description: ! 'SoOSiM is a simulator developed for the purpose of exploring operating

  system concepts and operating system modules. The simulator provides a

  highly abstracted view of a computing system, consisting of computing

  nodes, and components that are concurrently executed on these nodes.

  OS modules are subsequently modelled as components that progress as a

  result of reacting to two types of events: messages from other components,

  or a system-wide tick event. Using this abstract view, a developer can

  quickly formalize assertions regarding the interaction between operating

  system modules and applications.'

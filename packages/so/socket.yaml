description: ! 'This package provides access to the system''s socket interface with
  POSIX semantics.


  The library is designed to be threadsafe and establishes a thin layer on

  top of the underlying ccalls to help with the development of concurrent applications.

  It integrates with GHC''s event management mechanism (which itself uses epoll

  or libev or similar) and makes all functions have blocking semantics

  without actually blocking the runtime system.'

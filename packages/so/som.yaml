description: ! 'A Kohonen Self-organising Map (SOM) maps input patterns

  onto a regular grid (usually two-dimensional) where each

  node in the grid is a model of the input data, and does

  so using a method which ensures that any topological

  relationships within the input data are also represented

  in the grid. This implementation supports the use of

  non-numeric patterns.


  In layman''s terms, a SOM can be useful when you you want

  to discover the underlying structure of some data.

description: ! 'Type-enforced sorted lists and related functions.


  These are useful for:


  * Constraining the argument of a function to be a sorted list

  by stating in your type that the input list is a sorted list.


  * Avoiding sorting a list twice.


  * Creating a list that is sorted from the moment of its construction,

  so it doesn''t have to be sorted later.


  * Performing list operations keeping the input list sorted.


  * Improving those list operations that can be

  benefited from the ordering of its elements.


  * Creating infinite lists that are sorted!


  * And more!


  If you are missing a feature, do not hesitate

  to ask by opening an issue at the bug-tracker.'

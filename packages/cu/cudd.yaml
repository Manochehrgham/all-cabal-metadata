description: ! 'Bindings to version 2.5.0 of the CUDD binary decision diagrams library.


  <http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/>


  /Installation/


  Either install CUDD using your system''s package manager or download and build CUDD
  from here: <https://github.com/adamwalker/cudd>. This is a mirror of the CUDD source
  that has been modified to build shared object files.


  If you chose the latter option you need to tell cabal where to find cudd:


  "cabal install cudd --extra-include-dirs=\/path\/to\/cudd\/src\/include --extra-lib-dirs=\/path\/to\/cudd\/src\/libso"


  and you need to tell your program where to find the shared libraries:


  "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\/path\/to\/cudd\/src\/libso ghci"


  /Usage/


  This package provides two interfaces to the CUDD library:


  * A purely functional one in "Cudd.Cudd" that automatically dereferences BDDs during
  garbage collection.


  * An ST Monad based one in "Cudd.Imperative" that gives you precise control over
  the ordering of BDD operations and when BDDs are dereferenced. Use this one if you
  want your code to perform well.'

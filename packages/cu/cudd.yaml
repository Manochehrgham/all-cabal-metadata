description: ! 'Bindings to version 3.0.0 of the CUDD binary decision diagrams library.


  <http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/>


  /Installation/


  Either install CUDD 3.0.0 using your system''s package manager or download and install
  CUDD from here: <http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/>.


  Then:


  "cabal install cudd"


  /Usage/


  This package provides two interfaces to the CUDD library:


  * A purely functional one in "Cudd.Cudd" that automatically dereferences BDDs during
  garbage collection.


  * An ST Monad based one in "Cudd.Imperative" that gives you precise control over
  the ordering of BDD operations and when BDDs are dereferenced. Use this one if you
  want your code to perform well.


  Also, for a higher level interface in the style of the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ersatz
  ersatz> SAT encoder, see <https://github.com/jwaldmann/cudd-ersatz/>.'

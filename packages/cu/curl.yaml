synopsis: Haskell binding to libcurl
changelog: ! "Version 1.3.8\n  Add Eq instances for some types.\n\n\nVersion 1.3.4:
  released 2009-01-18; changes from 1.3.3\n\n  * Overloaded Network.Curl operations
  over response representation\n    of payloads and headers. Controlled via CurlBuffer
  and CurlHeader\n    classes. New actions:\n       - curlGetString_, curlGetResponse_,
  \n         perform_with_response_, do_curl_, curlHead_\n        \n  * Provided ByteString
  instances (strict and lazy)\n  * No modification in calling interface to existing
  exports,\n    so backwards compatible.\n  * Added Show instance for Network.Curl.Opts.CurlOption\n
  \ * curl_version_string, curl_version_number now gives you access\n    to version
  info of underlying lib you _compiled_ the package with.\n  * Sync'ed wrt libcurl-7.19.2,
  so bunch of new options added to\n    Network.Curl.Opts. Use version functions to
  determine if they\n    are supported though.\n"

synopsis: FFI binding to the CUDA interface for programming NVIDIA GPUs
changelog: ! "0.6.6.2\n\n  * Build fix\n\n0.6.6.1\n\n  * Build fixes for ghc-7.6 and
  ghc-7.10\n\n0.6.6.0\n\n  * Drop support for CUDA 3.0 and older.\n\n  * Combine the
  definition of the 'Event' and 'Stream' data types. As of\n    CUDA-3.1 these data
  structures are equivalent, and can be safely shared\n    between runtime and driver
  API calls and libraries.\n\n  * Mark FFI imports of potentially long-running API
  functions as safe. This\n    allows them to be safely called from Haskell threads
  without blocking the\n    entire HEC.\n\n  * Add compute-capability data for 3.7,
  5.2 devices.\n\n0.6.5.1\n\n  * Build fix for Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)\n\n0.6.5.0\n\n
  \ * Add support for the CUDA-6.5 release\n\n"

description: ! 'The CUDA library provides a direct, general purpose C-like SPMD programming

  model for NVIDIA graphics cards (G8x series onwards). This is a collection

  of bindings to allow you to call and control, although not write, such

  functions from Haskell-land. You will need to install the CUDA driver and

  developer toolkit.


  <http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>


  The configure script will look for your CUDA installation in the standard

  places, and if the nvcc compiler is found in your PATH, relative to that.


  This release is for version 6.5 of the CUDA toolkit.


  [/NOTE:/]


  Due to a bug in nvcc, this package is not compatible with c2hs-0.18.* or

  c2hs-0.19.*. See tmcdonell/cuda#18.

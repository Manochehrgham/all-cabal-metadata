description: ! 'The CUDA library provides a direct, general purpose C-like SPMD programming

  model for NVIDIA graphics cards (G8x series onwards). This is a collection

  of bindings to allow you to call and control, although not write, such

  functions from Haskell-land. You will need to install the CUDA driver and

  developer toolkit.


  <http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>


  The configure script will look for your CUDA installation in the standard

  places, and if the nvcc compiler is found in your PATH, relative to that.


  This release is for version 6.5 of the CUDA toolkit.


  [/NOTE:/]


  Due to a bug in nvcc, this package is not compatible with c2hs-0.18.* or

  c2hs-0.19.*. See tmcdonell/cuda#18.

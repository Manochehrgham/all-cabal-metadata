synopsis: FFI binding to the CUDA interface for programming NVIDIA GPUs
changelog: ! "0.7.0.0\n\n  * Add support for operations from CUDA-7.0\n\n  * Add support
  for online linking\n\n  * Add support for inter-process communication\n\n  * Bug
  fixes, extra documentation, improve library coverage.\n\n  * Mac OS X no longer
  requires the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in\n    order to compile or
  run programs that use this package.\n\n0.6.7.0\n\n  * Add support for building on
  Windows (thanks to mwu-tow)\n\n0.6.6.2\n\n  * Build fix\n\n0.6.6.1\n\n  * Build
  fixes for ghc-7.6 and ghc-7.10\n\n0.6.6.0\n\n  * Drop support for CUDA 3.0 and older.\n\n
  \ * Combine the definition of the 'Event' and 'Stream' data types. As of\n    CUDA-3.1
  these data structures are equivalent, and can be safely shared\n    between runtime
  and driver API calls and libraries.\n\n  * Mark FFI imports of potentially long-running
  API functions as safe. This\n    allows them to be safely called from Haskell threads
  without blocking the\n    entire HEC.\n\n  * Add compute-capability data for 3.7,
  5.2 devices.\n\n0.6.5.1\n\n  * Build fix for Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite)\n\n0.6.5.0\n\n
  \ * Add support for the CUDA-6.5 release\n\n"

description: ! "Haskell FFI Bindings to CUDA\n============================\n\n[![Build
  status](https://travis-ci.org/tmcdonell/cuda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tmcdonell/cuda)\n\nThe
  CUDA library provides a direct, general purpose C-like SPMD programming\nmodel for
  NVIDIA graphics cards (G8x series onwards). This is a collection of\nbindings to
  allow you to call and control, although not write, such functions\nfrom Haskell-land.
  You will need to install the CUDA driver and developer\ntoolkit.\n\n  <http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda.html>\n\nThe
  configure step will look for your CUDA installation in the standard places,\nand
  if the `nvcc` compiler is found in your `PATH`, relative to that.\n\nFor important
  information on installing on Windows, see:\n\n  <https://github.com/tmcdonell/cuda/blob/master/WINDOWS.markdown>\n\n"

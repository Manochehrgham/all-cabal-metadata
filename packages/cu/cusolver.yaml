description: ! "Haskell FFI Bindings to cuSolver\n================================\n\n[![Build
  status](https://travis-ci.org/tmcdonell/cusolver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tmcdonell/cusolver)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/cusolver.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cusolver)\n\nThe
  cuSolver library provides useful LAPACK-like features implemented on NVIDIA\nGPUs,
  such as common matrix factorization and triangular solve routines for\ndense matrices,
  a sparse least-squares solver routine, and an eigenvalue solver.\nThis package provides
  FFI bindings to the functions of the cuSolver library. You\nwill need to install
  the CUDA driver and developer toolkit:\n\n  <http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>\n\n

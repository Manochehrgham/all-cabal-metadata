description: ! 'This library supports efficient manipulating of 2D cubic bezier curves.  The
  original goal

  is to support typography, but it is useful for general graphics.  Supported features
  are:


  Evaluating bezier curves and derivatives, affine transformations on bezier curves,
  arclength and inverse arclength, intersections between two curves, intersection
  between a curve and a line, curvature and radius of curvature, finding tangents
  parallel to a vector, finding inflection points and cusps.


  It also supports polynomial root finding with Bernstein polynomials.


  The module "Geom2D.CubicBezier" exports all the cubic bezier functions.  The module
  "Geom2D"

  contains general 2D geometry functions and transformations.'

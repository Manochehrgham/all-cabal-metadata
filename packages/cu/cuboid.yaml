description: ! 'A simple 3D puzzle game made with Yampa and GLUT.  The objective

  of the game is to get the red sphere to the green sphere, by

  moving the red sphere.


  Use the W and D keys to rotate the cube, and the arrow keys

  (up\/down\/left\/right), to move the red ball (front\/back\/left\/right

  respectively).  The red sphere will then move until it hits an

  obstacle (green cube) and then stops.


  In order to add levels check out Game.hs. If you come up with

  a great level do send it to me. I plan to extract the levels

  into a configuration file in the future.'

description: ! 'A comprehensive and efficient implementation of AVL trees. The raw
  AVL

  API has been designed with efficiency and generality in mind, not elagance or

  safety. It contains all the stuff you really don''t want to write yourself if you

  can avoid it. This library may be useful for rolling your own Sets, Maps, Sequences,

  Queues (for example).'

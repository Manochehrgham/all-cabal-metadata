description: ! "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hce/avutils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hce/avutils)\n\navwx\n====\n\nFetch
  and parse aviation weather reports.\n\nCurrently, only standard METAR reports are
  supported, subject to extensive\ntesting. RMK sections are not yet supported. Making
  this parser work with all METARs is pretty tedious and difficult,\nbecause every
  country seems to be using some subtly different specification.\nThis parser was
  written with the publicly available documentation from\nDWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst)
  in mind, so it should work with all German\nMETARs. Patches (pull requests) and
  suggestions are very welcome!\n\nImportant: \"For educational purposes only, *not*
  for flight planning! Use at\nyour own risk.\"\n\n# Usage\n\nThis package is intended
  to be used as a library. However, for demonstration purposes,\nit comes with a small
  command line utility that can be invoked like this:\n\n    hc@hc-pc ~ Î» metar eddf
  llbg eham tncm\n\nThe output will look like this:\n\n    Fetching weather information
  for eddf\n    Parsing \"METAR EDDF 281650Z 15006KT 9999 FEW034 SCT048 BKN130 22/15

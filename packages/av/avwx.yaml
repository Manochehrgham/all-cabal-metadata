description: ! "avwx\n====\n\nFetch and parse aviation weather reports.\n\nCurrently,
  only standard METAR reports are supported, subject to extensive\ntesting. RMK sections
  are not yet supported. Making this parser work with all METARs is pretty tedious
  and difficult,\nbecause every country seems to be using some subtly different specification.\nThis
  parser was written with the publicly available documentation from\nDWD (Deutscher
  Wetterdienst) in mind, so it should work with all German\nMETARs. Patches (pull
  requests) and suggestions are very welcome!\n\nImportant: \"For educational purposes
  only, *not* for flight planning! Use at\nyour own risk.\"\n\n# Usage\n\nThis package
  is intended to be used as a library. However, for demonstration purposes,\nit comes
  with a small command line utility that can be invoked like this:\n\n    hc@hc-pc
  ~ Î» metar eddf llbg eham tncm\n\nThe output will look like this:\n\n    Fetching
  weather information for eddf\n    Parsing \"METAR EDDF 281650Z 15006KT 9999 FEW034

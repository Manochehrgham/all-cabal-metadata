synopsis: Parse METAR weather reports
changelog: ! '# 0.2.0.0


  Many improvements by Tony Morris:


  * Turn on GHC warnings

  * The parser uses hackage/parsers library, so a user can choose the parser implementation
  e.g. attoparsec, parsec.

  * A METAR optionally ends in $ or = instead of necessarily.

  * Added a field to `Weather` for ending in $ (meaning the station requires maintenance).

  * Added classy lenses to the data types.

  * Updated the new noaa.gov METAR publication website for fetching.

  * Moved parseWeather over to the `Fetcher` module so the parser does not ever import
  attoparsec.

  * Make `Station` a newtype.


  # Jun 28 2016


  * First release.

description: ! "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hce/avwx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hce/avwx)\n\navwx\n====\n\nFetch
  and parse aviation weather reports.\n\nCurrently, only standard METAR reports are
  supported, subject to extensive\ntesting. RMK sections are not yet supported. Making
  this parser work with all METARs is pretty tedious and difficult,\nbecause every
  country seems to be using some subtly different specification.\nThis parser was
  written with the publicly available documentation from\nDWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst)
  in mind, so it should work with all German\nMETARs. Patches (pull requests) and
  suggestions are very welcome!\n\nImportant: \"For educational purposes only, *not*
  for flight planning! Use at\nyour own risk.\"\n\n# Usage\n\nThis package is intended
  to be used as a library. However, for demonstration purposes,\nit comes with a small
  command line utility that can be invoked like this:\n\n    hc@hc-pc ~ Î» metar eddf
  llbg eham tncm\n\nThe output will look like this:\n\n    Fetching weather information
  for eddf\n    Parsing \"METAR EDDF 281650Z 15006KT 9999 FEW034 SCT048 BKN130 22/15

description: ! '

  This package implements a minimal ML-like language to demonstrate how the W

  algorithm works.


  The ''ML'' module contains the definition of the language in the form of an

  Haskell data type, plus functions to parse files and pretty print the

  datatype.


  The ''TypeInfer'' module contains the W algorithm itself.


  The ''Main'' module contains a program that parses and typechecks programs

  reading from standard input.


  The library and executable is compatible with GHC and Hugs (to use Hugs

  with cabal use the flag @--hugs@).'

synopsis: Extras for Fn, a functional web framework.
changelog: ! "* 0.3.0.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2016-3-2\n\n  - Switch
  Heist to use StateT rather than ReaderT, so splices can\n    update context.\n  -
  Add support for compiled heist.\n  - Add support for digestive functors. Note: current
  (significant)\n    limitation is that if you have _already_ parsed the request body\n
  \   with `!=>` then we can only use post params and not files. This is\n    because
  `Fn` parses them to lazy bytestrings, but digestive\n    functors wants them in
  temporary files, and for now, we're not\n    converting (it could be done). But,
  the expectation is that if you\n    are using digestive functors, you won't ever
  be parsing post\n    bodies with `!=>`.\n\n* 0.2.0.1 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net>
  2016-1-20\n\n  - Fix for GHC 7.8.4, which cabal file said would work, but didn't.\n\n*
  0.2.0.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-11-5\n\n  - Add `heistServe`, which
  serves templates according to path.\n  - Remove `heistLens` and `setHeist` from
  `HeistContext` type class,\n    as they aren't used.\n\n* 0.1.1.0 Daniel Patterson
  <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-30\n\n  - Add `tag'`, which builds splices without atttributes.\n\n*
  0.1.0.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-26\n\n  - Initial release.\n"

description: ! '## About


  This repository has some helpers that have heavier dependencies than

  core [fn](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fn). In general, things get added

  here whenever using libraries on their own conflicts with the design

  goals of `Fn`. This could mean that there is a lot of boilerplate to

  get them set up, or they are heavily monadic (in which case the code

  here serves to make them use more normal functions).

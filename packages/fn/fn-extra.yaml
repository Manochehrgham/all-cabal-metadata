description: ! '## About


  This repository has some helpers that have heavier dependencies than

  core [fn](http://hackage.haskell.org). In general, things get added

  here whenever using libraries on their own conflicts with the design

  goals of `Fn`. This could mean that there is a lot of boilerplate to

  get them set up, or they are heavily monadic (in which case the code

  here serves to make them use more normal functions).

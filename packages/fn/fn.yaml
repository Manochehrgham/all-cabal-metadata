synopsis: A functional web framework.
changelog: ! "* 0.2.0.2 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2016-1-20\n\n  - Fixe for
  GHC 7.8, which cabal file said would work, but didn't.\n\n* 0.2.0.1 Daniel Patterson
  <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-12-4\n\n  - Fix bug in url routing where \"/foo/bar\", \"/foo/bar/\",
  and\n    \"/foo//bar\" were all treated differently.\n\n* 0.2.0.0 Daniel Pattersion
  <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-11-5\n\n  - Changed to having our own `FnRequest` type, which
  is a WAI\n    `Request` and the results of parsing the body for contents, since\n
  \   we need to be able to do that once and thread it through.\n  - Add `file` and
  `files` matchers, which match against and pass file\n    uploads to handlers.\n
  \ - Add `staticServe` to serve static files based on path.\n\n* 0.1.4.0 Daniel Pattersion
  <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-11-4\n\n  - Move `ctxt` back to first parameter passed to
  handlers, via more\n    continuations.\n\n* 0.1.3.1 Daniel Pattersion <dbp@dbpmail.net>
  2015-10-31\n\n  - Add `method` matcher to match against HTTP method.\n\n* 0.1.3.0
  Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-30\n\n  - Allow nested calls to `route`,
  by changing `Request` in\n    `ctxt`. This necesitated changing it so that the `ctxt`
  is passed\n    to handlers _last_, instead of first, because we need to have\n    completed
  matching before we can change the request.\n  - Add `anything` route matcher that
  matches anything.\n  - Add `paramMany` matcher that returns a list of values for
  the\n    given query param.\n  - Change `param` to fail if more than one value is
  in query string.\n\n* 0.1.2.0 Daniel Pattersion <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-27\n\n
  \ - Rename `paramOptional` to `paramOpt`, to match `fn-extra`'s `Heist`\n    naming
  of `attr` and `attrOpt`.\n  - Remove `paramPresent`, because you\n    can get that
  behavior by parsing to `Text`.\n\n* 0.1.1.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net> 2015-10-26\n\n
  \ - Rename `Param` class to `FromParam`.\n\n* 0.1.0.0 Daniel Patterson <dbp@dbpmail.net>
  2015-10-25\n\n  - Initial release.\n"

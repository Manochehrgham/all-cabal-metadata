description: ! 'CQL Cassandra driver supporting native protocol versions 2 and 3.


  This library uses the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cql cql> library

  which implements Cassandra''s CQL protocol and complements it with the

  neccessary I/O operations. The feature-set includes:


  * /Node discovery/. The driver discovers nodes automatically from a small

  set of bootstrap nodes.


  * /Customisable load-balancing policies/. In addition to pre-built LB

  policies such as round-robin, users of this library can provide their

  own policies if desired.


  * /Support for connection streams/. Requests can be multiplexed over a

  few connections.


  * /Customisable retry settings/. Support for default retry settings as well

  as local overrides per query.


  * /Prepared queries/. Prepared queries are an optimisation which parse

  and prepare a query only once on Cassandra nodes but execute it many

  times with different concrete values.'

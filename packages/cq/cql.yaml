description: ! 'Implementation of Cassandra''s CQL Binary Protocol

  <https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/doc/native_protocol_v2.spec Version
  2>

  and

  <https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/doc/native_protocol_v3.spec Version

  It provides encoding and decoding functionality as well as representations

  of the various protocol related types.

description: ! 'This package contains code for generating high quality random

  numbers that follow either a uniform or normal distribution.  The

  generated numbers are suitable for use in statistical applications.


  The uniform PRNG uses Marsaglia''s MWC256 (also known as MWC8222)

  multiply-with-carry generator, which has a period of 2^8222 and

  fares well in tests of randomness.  It is also extremely fast,

  between 2 and 3 times faster than the Mersenne Twister.


  Compared to the mersenne-random package, this package has a more

  convenient API, is faster, and supports more statistical

  distributions.'

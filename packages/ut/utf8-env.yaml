description: ! 'UTF-8 aware substitutes for functions in System.Environment

  It was tested with GHC 6.10.1 in Unix (Linux) environment.

  Hugs users do not need this package.

  Import System.Environment.UTF8 into your program, and

  use functions like getArgs and getEnv in usual way.

  UTF8-aware locale is expected, that is, environment

  has setting of LANG = en_US.utf8 or similar.'

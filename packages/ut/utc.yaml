description: ! 'This library aims to supply you with common

  types and operations for working with time and date.


  * Parsing and rendering common formats like ISO8601 and RFC3339.


  * Modifying dates and times in a way that is easy to understand

  and not overengineered (srsly, who needs something else than the

  Gregorian Calendar?)


  * A set of classes that provide interfaces for your own application

  specific or maybe more efficient time and date types. Implement the

  interfaces and get all the parsing and rendering functions for free!


  This is a work in progress!


  Try it out and play with it. Tell me what you think

  about the API design and naming, but __DON''T USE IT

  IN PRODUCTION YET!__


  Bug reports or (even better) tests are welcome.'

description: ! 'If you want your Haskell code to have UTF8 text I/O then use libraries
  which have UTF8 text I/O.

  In case of Prelude with this package only three mechanical steps needed:


  * In all modules import Prelude explicitly and replace every occurrence of "Prelude"
  with "UTF8Prelude".


  * Use the NoImplicitPrelude language extension.


  * In all modules replace every occurrence of "System.IO" with "System.UTF8IO".


  utf8-test tests several functions regarding UTF8 text I/O.

  Note: utf8-test creates a file named writeFile_test.txt (5,3K) in the current working
  directory.


  utf8-prelude is based on utf8-string:

  This package will be obsolete *after* GHC 6.10:

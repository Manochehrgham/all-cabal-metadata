description: ! 'OpenGLRaw is a raw Haskell binding for the OpenGL 4.5 graphics system
  and

  lots of OpenGL extensions. It is basically a 1:1 mapping of OpenGL''s C API,

  intended as a basis for a nicer interface. OpenGLRaw offers access to all

  necessary functions, tokens and types plus a general facility for loading

  extension entries. The module hierarchy closely mirrors the naming structure

  of the OpenGL extensions, making it easy to find the right module to import.

  All API entries are loaded dynamically, so no special C header files are

  needed for building this package. If an API entry is not found at runtime, a

  userError is thrown.


  OpenGL is the industry''s most widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics

  application programming interface (API), incorporating a broad set of

  rendering, texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful visualization

  functions. For more information about OpenGL and its various extensions,

  please see <http://www.opengl.org/>

  and <http://www.opengl.org/registry/>.'

description: ! 'This library makes it easy to implement monads with tricky control
  flow.


  This is useful for: writing web applications in a sequential style, programming
  games with a uniform interface for human and AI players and easy replay capababilities,
  implementing fast parser monads, designing monadic DSLs, etc.


  See the project homepage <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Operational> for a more
  detailed introduction and features.

description: ! 'This is a wrapper around <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/crypto-api>

  and related libraries that currently does fingerprint generation, signature

  generation, signature verification, and both asymmetric and symmetric

  encryption and decryption.


  It is indended to be used with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/openpgp>


  It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.

description: ! 'This is an OpenPGP library inspired by my work on OpenPGP libraries
  in

  Ruby <https://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp>,

  PHP <http://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp-php>,

  and Python <https://github.com/singpolyma/OpenPGP-Python>.


  It defines types to represent OpenPGP messages as a series of packets

  and then defines instances of Data.Binary for each to facilitate

  encoding/decoding.


  For performing cryptography, see

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/openpgp-crypto-api> or

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/openpgp-Crypto>


  For dealing with ASCII armor, see

  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/openpgp-asciiarmor>


  It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.


  > import qualified Data.OpenPGP as OpenPGP'

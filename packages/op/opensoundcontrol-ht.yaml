description: ! 'Some additional modules I use

  in connection with the SuperCollider wrapper hsc3 by Rohan Drape.

  It contains:


  * a @Transport@ handle type for writing to files


  * a @Transport@ monad type for writing to a bytestring without IO.


  Also see the supercollider-ht package which uses this one.'

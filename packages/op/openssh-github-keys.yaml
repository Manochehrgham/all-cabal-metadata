  This package fetches the OpenSSH public keys for all users from a

  GitHub team. It is intended to be executed from the AuthorizedKeys

  command in the sshd_config file, which then allows users to log in

  using keys that they have in their Github accounts.


  Please see the

  <https://github.com/stackbuilders/openssh-github-keys GitHub page>

  for detailed usage information.

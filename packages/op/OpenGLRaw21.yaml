description: ! 'This package simply reexports a subset of the

  parts of OpenGLRaw which are compatible with

  OpenGL 2.1. The idea is that you can have greater

  certainty about compatibility with less capable

  graphics cards by only importing

  Graphics.Rendering.OpenGL.Raw.Core21 and the exact

  modules for whatever additional extensions you

  need.'

description: ! 'A Haskell binding for the OpenAL cross-platform 3D audio API,

  appropriate for use with gaming applications and many other

  types of audio applications.


  On Windows, this package works well with the \"OpenAL Soft\" binary

  distribution from <http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html>.

  Type \''cabal install --extra-lib-dirs=\<DIR\>\'' where \<DIR\> is the

  directory where libOpenAL32.dll.a is located (must be an absolute path).

  Then rename soft_oal.dll to OpenAL32.dll and put it somewhere in

  the PATH. I found that c:\\Windows\\ worked.


  This package has also been tested on GNU/Linux and iOS.'

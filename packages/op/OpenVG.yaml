  A Haskell binding for the OpenVG vector graphics API version

  1.0.1, specifically the ShivaVG-0.2.1 implementation.


  This version (0.7.0) should be compatible with the Haskell

  Platform (2013.2.0.0).


  \*\* WARNING - large parts of the API (particular the Paths

  module) are untested and may be revised in future. \*\*.


  Changelog


  0.6.0 to 0.7.0


  * Updated to work with GHC 7.6 and Platform 2013.2.0.0.


  * Updated Windows install instructions.


  0.5.0 to 0.6.0


  * Added an opaque matrix type to RenderingQuality.

  Acknowledgement - this was derived from the Matrix class

  in HOpenGL.


  * Revised Image module - PixelData is now an opaque type rather

  than a raw pointer.


  * Work on Path module - pathBounds implemented. This module is

  entirely untested and may change again in the future.

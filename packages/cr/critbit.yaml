description: ! 'This package implements crit-bit trees, a key-value container type

  for storing keys that can be treated as bitstrings (e.g.

  ''ByteString'' and ''Text'').


  Compared to the data structures from the containers and

  unordered-containers packages, you will find that sometimes the

  functions implemented in this package are faster, sometimes

  slower.


  In many cases, a ''CritBit'' tree provides performance close to that

  of a ''HashMap'', while providing ordered storage and traversal

  like a ''Map''.'

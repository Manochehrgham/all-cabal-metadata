description: ! 'Cairo backend for Craftwerk, a high-level and easy to use graphics
  library

  with integrated TikZ output.


  Craftwerk is a high-level 2D vector graphics library for output of

  TikZ pictures that can be typeset using (pdf)LaTeX. The TikZ library

  and documentation can be found at: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf>.


  Craftwerk tries to encapsulate the graphics backend such that figures

  can also be rendered with a Cairo backend and quickly displayed in a

  Gtk window. The aim is to support TikZ and Cairo seamlessly as

  possible, meaning that graphics produced with either backend should

  look as similar as possible. Other backends are easily written and the

  aim is to provide generic fallback functions for features that are not

  natively supported by some backend.'

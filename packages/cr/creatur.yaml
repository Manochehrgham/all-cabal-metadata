description: ! 'A software framework for automating experiments

  with artificial life. It provides a daemon which

  maintains its own "clock", schedules events,

  provides logging, and ensures that each agent gets

  its turn to use the CPU. You can use other

  applications on the computer at the same time

  without fear of interfering with experiments; they

  will run normally, just more slowly. See the

  tutorial at

  <https://github.com/mhwombat/creatur-examples/raw/master/Tutorial.pdf>

  for examples on how to use the

  Créatúr framework.


  About the name: \"Créatúr\" (pronounced kray-toor)

  is an Irish word meaning animal, creature, or an

  unfortunate person.'

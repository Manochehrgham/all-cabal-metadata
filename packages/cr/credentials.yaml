description: ! 'This library provides a unified interface for managing secure, shared
  credentials.

  It uses Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) for master key management, locally

  encrypts and decrypts secrets, which are then stored in any of the supported

  storage backends. (Currently DynamoDB.)


  The use-case is to avoid storing sensitive information such as passwords and

  connection strings in plaintext in places such as source control or on

  developers'' machines. Instead you can securely administer and distribute

  secrets, leveraging Amazon''s IAM policies for access control and permissions to

  ensure limited read-only permissions from production/deployed hosts.

  You can embed this library into projects such as web applications to securely

  retrieve sensitive information such as database passwords or private keys on startup.


  A complementary CLI for management of credentials can be installed via

  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/credentials-cli credentials-cli>.


  You can read more about other use-cases and prerequisites <https://github.com/brendanhay/credentials
  here>.'

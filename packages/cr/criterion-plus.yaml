description: ! 'A dome library over \"criterion\",

  which enhances it with the following features:


  * Support for partial measuring, e.g., exclusion of the setup/teardown phases.


  * Generation of multiple unrelated comparison reports.


  * A flexible monadic API,

  which allows you to benchmark monad transformers and

  control which parts you actually want measured.

description: ! 'The library provides implementation of the second-order, linear

  conditional random fields (CRFs) with position-wise constraints

  imposed over label values.  Each label consists of a vector of

  smaller, atomic labels, and over each tier (layer) a separate

  set of model features is defined.'

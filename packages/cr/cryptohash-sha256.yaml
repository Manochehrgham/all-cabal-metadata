synopsis: Fast, pure and practical SHA-256 implementation
changelog: ! "## 0.11.7.2\n\n - switch to 'safe' FFI for calls where overhead becomes
  neglible\n - removed inline assembly in favour of portable C constructs\n - fix
  32bit length overflow bug in `hash` function\n - fix inaccurate context-size\n -
  add context-size verification to incremental API operations\n\n## 0.11.7.1\n\n -
  first version forked off `cryptohash-0.11.7` release\n"

description: ! 'A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the

  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2 SHA-256 hash algorithm>

  with performance close to the fastest implementations available in other languages.


  The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides the C implementation.


  NOTE: This package has been forked off @cryptohash-0.11.7@ because the @cryptohash@
  package has been

  deprecated and so this package continues to satisfy the need for a lightweight package

  providing the SHA256 hash algorithm without any dependencies on packages other than

  @base@ and @bytestring@.


  Consequently, this package can be used as a drop-in replacement for @cryptohash@''s

  "Crypto.Hash.SHA256" module, though with a clearly smaller footprint.'

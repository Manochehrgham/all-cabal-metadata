description: ! 'A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the

  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2 SHA-256 hash algorithm>

  with performance close to the fastest implementations available in other languages.


  The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides the C implementation.


  NOTE: This package has been forked off @cryptohash-0.11.7@ because the @cryptohash@
  has been

  deprecated and so this package continues to satisfy the need for a lightweight package

  providing the SHA256 hash algorithm without any dependencies on packages other than

  @base@ and @bytestring@.


  Consequently, this package can be used as a drop-in replacement for @cryptohash@''s

  "Crypto.Hash.SHA256" module, though with a clearly smaller footprint.'

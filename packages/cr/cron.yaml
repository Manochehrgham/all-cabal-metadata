description: ! 'Cron data structure and Attoparsec parser. The idea is to embed it
  in larger

  systems which want to roll their own scheduled tasks in a format that people

  are used to.

  ''System.Cron'' is where all the interesting datatypes live. You will also find

  ''scheduleMatches'', which you can use to compare a time against a

  ''CronSchedule'' to see if an action needs to be performed.  System.Cron.Parser

  is where you will find the parsers `cronSchedule`, `crontabEntry` and

  `cronTab`. To parse individual schedules up to full crontab files.'

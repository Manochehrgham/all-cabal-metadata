description: ! 'risc386 is a symbolic Intel(R) 386 assembler interpreter which

  allows infinitely many registers (temporaries).  Its purpose is

  to debug the output of a MiniJava compiler (from Andrew Appel''s

  book, Modern Compiler Implementation in JAVA) before register

  allocation has been performed.


  risc386 supports only a small fragment of i386 instructions.

  It expects its input to be a list of procedures in .intel_syntax

  each of which is started by a label and terminated by a return

  statement.


  Control flow is restricted, so, only jumps to procedure-local

  labels are allowed.  Reading from an uninitialized memory location

  will lead to an exception.'

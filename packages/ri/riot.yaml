description: ! 'Riot is a tool for keeping (textual) information organised. Some people

  call such programs ''outliners''. It is a todo list and note manager, and

  a manager for whatever information one might collect, that I wrote

  because I couldn''t find a single one that was at all close to what I

  wanted. Riot has an interface resembling those of slrn and mutt and all

  text editing is done with an external editor: Riot is simply a

  nice-to-use browser for collections of text.'

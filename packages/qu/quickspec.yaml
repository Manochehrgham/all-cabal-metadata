description: ! 'QuickSpec automatically finds equational laws about your program.


  Give it an API, i.e. a collection of functions, and it will spit out

  equations about those functions. For example, given @reverse@, @++@

  and @[]@, QuickSpec finds six laws, which are exactly the ones you

  might write by hand:


  > xs++[] == xs

  > []++xs == xs

  > (xs++ys)++zs == xs++(ys++zs)

  > reverse [] == []

  > reverse (reverse xs) == xs

  > reverse xs++reverse ys == reverse (ys++xs)


  The laws that QuickSpec generates are not proved correct, but have

  passed at least 200 QuickCheck tests.

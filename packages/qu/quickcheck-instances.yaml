description: ! 'QuickCheck instances.


  The goal is to supply QuickCheck instances for

  types provided by the Haskell Platform.


  Since all of these instances are provided as

  orphans, I recommend that you do not use this library

  within another library module, so that you don''t

  impose these instances on down-stream consumers of

  your code.

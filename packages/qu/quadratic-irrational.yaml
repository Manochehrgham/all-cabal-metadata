description: ! 'A library for exact computation with

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_irrational quadratic irrationals>

  with support for exact conversion from and to

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_continued_fraction (potentially periodic)
  simple continued fractions>.


  A quadratic irrational is a number that can be expressed in the form


  > (a + b √c) / d


  where @a@, @b@ and @d@ are integers and @c@ is a square-free natural number.


  Some examples of such numbers are


  * @7/2@,


  * @√2@,


  * @(1 + √5)\/2@

  (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio the golden ratio>),


  * solutions to quadratic equations with rational constants – the

  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula quadratic formula> has a

  familiar shape.


  A simple continued fraction is a number expressed in the form


  > a + 1/(b + 1/(c + 1/(d + 1/(e + …))))


  or alternatively written as


  > [a; b, c, d, e, …]


  where @a@ is an integer and @b@, @c@, @d@, @e@, … are positive integers.


  Every finite SCF represents a rational number and every infinite, periodic

  SCF represents a quadratic irrational.


  > 3.5      = [3; 2]

  > (1+√5)/2 = [1; 1, 1, 1, …]

  > √2       = [1; 2, 2, 2, …]'

description: ! '/Quiver/ is a powerful stream processing library for

  combinatorial and monadic representation of computations

  over both inductive and coinductive data streams.


  It is similar to Gabriel Gonzalez''s /pipes/ and

  Michael Snoyman''s /conduit/, but generalises both

  with support for functor-based computations and

  a clean support for finite (i.e., inductive) data

  streams, both upstream and downstream of the computation

  being defined.'

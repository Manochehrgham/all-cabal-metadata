description: QuickTest inspects Haskell source files for unit tests, and runs all
  tests found through GHCi with a dynamically generated test harness. This means you
  can simply write properties about your code, and QuickTest will test these properties
  en masse using QuickCheck. QuickTest is based on quickcheck-script by Koen Claessen
  and John Hughes.

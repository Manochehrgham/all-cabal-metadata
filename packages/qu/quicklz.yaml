description: ! 'This package provides a high level binding to the QuickLZ

  compression library for @ByteStrings@, under the GPLv2

  license. QuickLZ is fast and compresses very well. Check out the

  home page: <http://quicklz.com>


  This package includes the QuickLZ 1.5.0 source code, at

  compression level 1 and streaming mode disabled.


  The versioning scheme for this package is unusual. QuickLZ tries to

  be as fast as possible, and will break backwards compatibility to

  achieve it in newer versions. This versioning scheme reflects the

  QuickLZ versioning scheme: the first three digits of version w.x.y.z

  are the quicklz version, with the ''z'' component (and any further

  needed ones) being updates to this package, not quicklz itself.'

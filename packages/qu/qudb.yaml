  ====


  qudb is a Quite Useless DB. You really shouldn''t use it yet. Learn a bit more on

  [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/qudb).

  You can also take a look at the occasionally refreshed

  [documentation of qudb''s internals](http://jstepien.github.com/qudb/).


  Run tests using `test/Test.lhs`.


  As this is my first project in Haskell I''d be really grateful for any comments.

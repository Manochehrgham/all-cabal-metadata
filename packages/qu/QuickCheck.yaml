synopsis: Automatic testing of Haskell programs
changelog: ! "QuickCheck 2.9 (released 2016-07-10)\n\t* Arbitrary, CoArbitrary and
  Function instances for more types\n\t* Generics for automatic Function instances\n\t*
  A new combinator \"again\" which undoes the effect of \"once\"\n\t* Remove \"exhaustive\"
  from Testable typeclass;\n\t  instead, combinators which are nonexhaustive (such
  as forAll)\n\t  call \"again\", which should be more robust\n\n\t* Drop support
  for GHC 6.x\n\n\t* Fixed bugs:\n\t\t* arbitrarySizedBoundedIntegral wasn't generating
  huge integers\n\t\t* verboseCheck failed with Test.QuickCheck.Function\n\t\t* label
  had a space leak\n\nQuickCheck 2.8.2 (released 2016-01-15)\n\t* GHC 8 support\n\t*
  Add Arbitrary and CoArbitrary instances for types in\n\t  containers package\n\t*
  Improve speed of shuffle combinator\n\t* Only print to stderr if it's a terminal.\n\t*
  Small changes: slightly improve documentation,\n\t  remove redundant constraints
  from some functions' types,\n\t  small improvements to Test.QuickCheck.All.\n\nQuickCheck
  2.8.1 (released 2015-04-03)\n\t* Fix bug where exceptions thrown printing counterexamples
  weren't\n\t  being caught when terminal output was disabled\n\t* Don't export Test.QuickCheck.Property.result\n\nQuickCheck
  2.8 (released 2015-03-18)\n\t* New features:\n\t\t* Support for GHC 7.10\n\t\t*
  Arbitrary instance for Natural\n\t\t* New generators shuffle and sublistOf\n\t\t*
  Support for generic coarbitrary\n\t\t* When using the cover combinator, insufficient
  coverage now\n\t\t  causes the property to fail\n\n\t* API changes:\n\t\t* Test.QuickCheck.Function:
  new pattern synonym Fn\n\t\t* genericShrink no longer requires Typeable\n\t\t* Result
  has a new constructor InsufficientCoverage\n\t\t* resize throws an error if the
  size is negative\n\n\t* Bug fixes:\n\t\t* Fix memory leaks\n\t\t* Exceptions thrown
  by callbacks now cause the test to fail\n\t\t* Fixed a bug where the cover combinator
  wouldn't give a\n\t\t  warning if coverage was 0%\n\nQuickCheck 2.7.3 (released
  2014-03-24)\n\t* Add annotations for Safe Haskell.\n\nQuickCheck 2.7.2 (released
  2014-03-22)\n\t* Fix bug in cabal file which broke cabal test\n\nQuickCheck 2.7.1
  (released 2014-03-20)\n\t* Fixed bug - the Small modifier didn't work on unsigned
  types\n\t* Changed arbitrarySizedIntegral to have an Integral constraint\n\t  instead
  of just Num\n\nQuickCheck 2.7 (released 2014-03-19)\n\n\t* New features:\n\t\t*
  New genericShrink function provides generic shrinking with GHC.\n\t\t* New combinator
  x === y: fails if x /= y, but also prints their values\n\t\t* New function generate
  :: Gen a -> IO a for running a generator.\n\t\t* New combinators infiniteList and
  infiniteListOf for generating infinite lists.\n\t\t* Several combinators added to
  the main Test.QuickCheck module which\n\t\t  were previously languishing in other
  modules. Of particular interest:\n\t\t  quickCheckAll, ioProperty.\n\t\t* New combinators
  delay and capture which can be used (unsafely!)\n\t\t  to reuse the random number
  seed. Useful for generating\n\t\t  polymorphic (rank-2) values.\n\t\t* A new Discard
  data type and a Testable instance for discarding test cases.\n\t\t* All modifiers
  now have Functor instances and accessor functions.\n\t\t* Pressing ctrl-C during
  shrinking now shows the last failed\n\t\t  test case, rather than the current shrinking
  candidate.\n\t\t* Experimental support for UHC. You will need the latest version
  of Cabal from git.\n\n\t* Better distribution of test data:\n\t\t* The Int generator
  now only generates fairly small numbers.\n\t\t* The new Small and Large modifiers
  control the distribution of integers\n\t\t  (Small generates small numbers, Large
  from the whole range).\n\t\t* Floating-point numbers shrink better.\n\n\t* Improved
  random number generation:\n\t\t* QuickCheck now uses TFGen rather than StdGen on
  newer versions\n\t\t  of GHC, because StdGen's random numbers aren't always random.\n\t\t*
  'variant' now uses a prefix code. This should prevent some\n\t\t  potential bananaskins
  with coarbitrary.\n\n\t* API changes:\n\t\t* The Gen monad now uses an abstract
  type QCGen rather than StdGen.\n\t\t* The Result type now returns the thrown exception
  and number\n\t\t  of failed shrink attempts.\n\t\t* Property is now a newtype rather
  than Gen Prop as it was before.\n\t\t* promote is moved into the new module Test.QuickCheck.Gen.Unsafe.\n\t\t*
  'printTestCase' is deprecated - its new name is 'counterexample'\n\t\t* 'morallyDubiousIOProperty'
  is deprecated - its new name is\n\t\t  'ioProperty', no moral judgement involved
  :)\n\nQuickCheck 2.6, released 2013-03-07\n\n\t* Add convenience Function instances
  for up to 7-tuples\n\t* Make stderr line buffered to reduce console I/O.\n\t* Return
  a flag to say whether the test case was interrupted.\n\nQuickCheck 2.5, released
  2012-06-18\n\n\t* Replace maxDiscard with maxDiscardRatio\n\t* Remove Testable ()
  instance.\n\t* Added a 'discard' exception that discards the current test case\n\t*
  Add accessors for modifiers (where it makes sense)\n\t* Rename 'stop' to 'abort'
  to avoid a name clash\n\t* Added a 'once' combinator\n\t* If a property is of type
  Bool, only run it once\n\t* Add coarbitraryEnum to Test.QuickCheck module.\n\t*
  Add 'coarbitrary' helper for Enums.\n\t* Rejiggled the formatting code to support
  multi-line error messages\n\t* Add instances for Ordering and Fixed.\n\t* Added
  arbitraryBoundedEnum generator (thanks to Antoine Latter).\n\t* Add verboseCheckAll
  and polyverboseCheck function for usability.\n"

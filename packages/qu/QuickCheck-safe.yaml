description: ! 'QuickCheck-safe reimplements the quickCheck functionality with a pure

  interface and a very small trusted base (see Test.QuickCheck.Safe.Trusted).


  * uses the existing Arbitrary instances


  * implemented features: testing, result minimization (i.e., shrinking)


  * missing features: expected failures, label frequencies, coverage


  The package is targeted at users who want to leverage SafeHaskell for

  sandboxing.

description: ! 'Data.Derive <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/derive> is good another
  solution for DrFIT.

  But DrFIT is Haskell 98 compliant, derive is not.


  DrIFT is a type sensitive preprocessor for Haskell. It extracts type declarations

  and directives from modules. The directives cause rules to be fired on the parsed

  type declarations, generating new code which is then appended to the bottom of the
  input

  file. The rules are expressed as Haskell code, and it is intended that the user
  can add new

  rules as required.


  DrIFT automates instance derivation for classes that aren''t supported by the standard
  compilers.

  In addition, instances can be produced in seperate modules to that containing the
  type declaration.

  This allows instances to be derived for a type after the original module has been
  compiled.

  As a bonus, simple utility functions can also be produced from a type.


  This package was cabalized by gwern <gwern0@gmail.com>.'

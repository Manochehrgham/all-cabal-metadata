description: ! 'A low-dimensional (2, 3, 4 and Quaternions) linear algebra library,

  with lots of useful functions. Forked from vect library at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vect>

  by Balazs Komuves in order to use Floating typeclass instead of Float, Double.

  Accelerate instances are available at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vect-floating-accelerate>.

  Many thanks to Balazs Komuves.'

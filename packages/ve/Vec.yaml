description: ! 'Vectors are represented by lists with type-encoded lengths. The constructor

  is @:.@, which acts like a cons both at the value and type levels, with @()@

  taking the place of nil. So @x:.y:.z:.()@ is a 3d vector. The library

  provides a set of common list-like functions (map, fold, etc) for working

  with vectors. Built up from these functions are a small but useful set of

  linear algebra operations: matrix multiplication, determinants, solving

  linear systems, inverting matrices.'

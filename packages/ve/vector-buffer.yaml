description: ! 'A buffer type that can easily be converted to a Data.Vector.Storable
  vector

  from the vector package and compatible with hmatrix.


  Elements are pushed into the buffer.  When the buffer is converted to a read-only

  vector, the last-pushed element occurs at the end.


  Monadic map functions also operate so that the last-pushed element is treated last.'

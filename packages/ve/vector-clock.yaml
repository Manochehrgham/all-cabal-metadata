description: ! 'This package provides a ready to use implementation of the

  vector clock data-structures, which may be used to version

  messages and determine causality relations between them in

  a distributed system.


  See @Fundamentals of Distributed Computing: A Practical Tour

  of Vector Clock Systems@ by R. Baldoni and M. Raynal for an

  overview of vector clocks.


  See the README.md file for details.'

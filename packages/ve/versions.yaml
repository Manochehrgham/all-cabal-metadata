description: ! 'A library for parsing and comparing software version numbers.


  We like to give version numbers to our software in a myriad of different

  ways. Some ways follow strict guidelines for incrementing and comparison.

  Some follow conventional wisdom and are generally self-consistent.

  Some are just plain asinine. This library provides a means of parsing

  and comparing /any/ style of versioning, be it a nice Semantic Version

  like this:


  > 1.2.3-r1+git123


  ...or a monstrosity like this:


  > 2:10.2+0.0093r3+1-1


  Please switch to <http://semver.org Semantic Versioning> if you

  aren''t currently using it. It provides consistency in version

  incrementing and has the best constraints on comparisons.'

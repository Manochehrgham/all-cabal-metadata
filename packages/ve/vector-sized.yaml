description: ! '# Vector Sized


  This package exports a newtype tagging the vectors from the

  [vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector) package with a type level

  natural representing their size.


  It also exports a few functions from vector appropriately retyped.


  This package is fairly similar to the

  [fixed-vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fixed-vector) package. The

  difference is that fixed-vector uses Peano naturals to represent the size tag

  on the vectors and this package uses typelits.


  The initial code for this package was written by @bgamari in a [PR for vulkan](https://github.com/expipiplus1/vulkan/pull/1)

description: ! 'This package provides bindings to the fftw library for one-dimensional
  vectors.

  It provides both high-level functions and more low-level manipulation of fftw plans.


  We provide three different modules which wrap fftw''s operations:


  - "Numeric.FFT.Vector.Unnormalized" contains the raw transforms;


  - "Numeric.FFT.Vector.Invertible" scales the backwards transforms to be true inverses;


  - "Numeric.FFT.Vector.Unitary" additionally scales all transforms to preserve the
  L2 (sum-of-squares) norm of the

  input.


  Note that this package is currently not thread-safe.'

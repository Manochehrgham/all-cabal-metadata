description: ! 'An API for efficient and convenient construction of vectors.

  It provides the composable `Builder` abstraction, which has instances of the `Monoid`
  and `Semigroup` classes.


  [Usage]


  First you use the `Builder` abstraction to specify the structure of the vector.

  Then you execute the builder to actually produce the vector.


  [Example]


  The following code shows how you can efficiently concatenate different datastructures
  into a single immutable vector:


  >

  >import qualified Data.Vector as A

  >import qualified VectorBuilder.Builder as B

  >import qualified VectorBuilder.Vector as C

  >

  >

  >myVector :: A.Vector a -> [a] -> a -> A.Vector a

  >myVector vector list element =

  >  C.build builder

  >  where

  >    builder =

  >      B.vector vector <>

  >      foldMap B.singleton list <>

  >      B.singleton element'

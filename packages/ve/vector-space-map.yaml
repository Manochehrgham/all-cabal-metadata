description: Data.Map.Vector provides @MapVector@, a wrapper around @Map@ from @containers@
  which supports constant maps, i.e. maps containing only one value.  This allows
  an identity under intersection and an @Applicative@ instance.  It also has instances
  of @AdditiveGroup@, @VectorSpace@, @InnerSpace@, and @Num@ with appropriate value
  types.  Provides operations for addition, subtraction, element-wise multiplication
  (through @Num@), scalar multiplication (through @VectorSpace@), and dot product.

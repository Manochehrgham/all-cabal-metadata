description: ! 'Build virtual machine images for vm-deployments; resize,

  un-partition, create from scratch or convert disk image

  files in a variety of formats; assemble and generate all

  associated files from templates and regular files.

  VM images can further be modifed through scripts, which are

  executed in LXC containers into which the vm-images as well

  as arbitrary directories from the host are mounted.

  All assembled files can also be accessed by vm build

  scripts through a special directory mounted in the build

  container, and/or can be written to directories, ISO- or

  VFAT-images.

  The ISO/VFAT images that B9 creates are compatible to

  ''cloud-init''s ''NoCloud'' data source;

  B9 is also very well suited for compiling in a

  containerized environment. For these applications, the

  images can be marked as ''Transient'' to indicate no further

  interest in the VM-image itself, and B9 will discard them

  after the build.

  B9 will never over-write source files, not even large

  vm-image files - there is no intended way to modify a

  source vm-image file ''in-place''.

  B9 operates in random build directories, which are

  discarded when the build exists.'

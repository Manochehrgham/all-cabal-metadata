description: ! 'This library tries to simplify deployment of common HTML constructs,
  for different

  HTML engines.


  Deployment, from this library''s perspective, means /how/ something can be

  rendered to markup, yet still achieve the same "result" to the end user (namely

  the DOM). For instance, we could use a @<link>@ tag to reference external Css,

  or we might insert the Css code /inline/ a @<style>@ tag.


  We use simple tags to infer the deployment mechanism for a context of

  markup. The three deployment mechanisms provided include


  * /inline/ - the asset inserted between markup tags


  * /local/ - assets on the current server


  * /remote/ - assets referenced with a complete URI'

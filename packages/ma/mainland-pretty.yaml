description: ! 'Pretty printing designed for printing source code based on

  Wadler''s paper /A Prettier Printer/. The main advantage of this

  library is its ability to automatically track the source

  locations associated with pretty printed values and output

  appropriate #line pragmas and its ability to produce output

  in the form of lazy text using a builder.'

description: ! 'The Majordomo Protocol (MDP) defines a reliable

  service-oriented request-reply dialog between a

  set of client applications, a broker and a set of

  worker applications. MDP covers presence,

  heartbeating, and service-oriented request-reply

  processing. It originated from the Majordomo

  pattern defined in Chapter 4 of the Guide.

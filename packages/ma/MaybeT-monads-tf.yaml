description: ! 'Support for computations with failures. This is a fork of the MaybeT

  package by Eric Kidd, but compatible with the type-family based monad

  classes of the monads-tf package.


  This package is deprecated: the MaybeT transformer exists in the

  transformers package nowadays, and the only advantage this package

  provides over that one is the presence of a MonadFix instance, but

  it''s incorrect anyway.'

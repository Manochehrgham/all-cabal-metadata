description: ! 'MazesOfMonad is a console-based Role Playing Game. You create characters

  with their strong and weak points, and try to complete mazes that are randomly generated.
  You can pick up gold and items on the way,

  meet monsters, and deal with them as you want. You can fight, use magic, bribe,
  trade, steal... This is only a simple game that I did to see what building a

  full blown Haskell application is like to develop. Versions 1.0.5 and above are
  complete and working.'

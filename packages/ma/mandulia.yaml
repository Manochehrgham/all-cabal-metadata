description: ! 'Mandulia provides a zooming visualisation of the Mandelbrot Set

  as many Julia Sets.  Featuring a profiled and optimized renderer,

  and a Lua configuration and scripting interface.


  Mandulia supports additional compile-time flags for speed, but by

  default these are disabled because they don''t work on all systems.

  These flags are "-ffast" for miscellaneous optimizations, and

  "-ffast -fSSE4" to use SSE4 instructions too.


  Changes from "mandulia-0.6": the optimization flags are disabled

  by default as they were causing problems on some systems; reduced

  visual jitter for smoother animation; smoother colour gradations;

  access runtime statistics from Lua scripts.'

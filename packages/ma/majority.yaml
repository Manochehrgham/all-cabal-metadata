description: ! 'The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm determines if there in a list
  of votes

  is a candidate that holds more than half of the majority, and if so, finds

  this candidate. It does so in time linear in the length of the input list and

  constant memory. For a detailed description of the algorithm, see these papers:

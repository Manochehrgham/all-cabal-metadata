synopsis: Automatic inductive functional programmer by systematic search
changelog: ! "0.9.6.5:\n  * Fix some bugs in CGI. Now you do not need to use GHC 7.4
  even for building the CGI.\n\n0.9.6.4.8:\n  * Fix some bugs and misfeatures in CGI\n
  \ * Replace the \"Interpreted as ...\" with more informative \"Corrected with ...\"
  in CGI\n\n0.9.6.4.7:\n  * Add this changelog.txt\n  * Implement copy by drag-and-drop\n
  \ * Add the build time to versionInfo, which is shown in the CGI frontend and by
  the :version command\n  * Use the time package instead of old-time, and use UTC\n\n0.9.6.4.6:\n
  \ * Fix the stupid bug of regarding Int as RealFrac, which crept into 0.9.6.4\n
  \ * Enable documentation of language constructs, such as let, in, if, then, else,
  etc., when typed in as a word.\n  * Fix documentation of operators starting with
  `:', which used to cause the `command unknown' error\n\n0.9.6.4.5:\n  * Fix and
  support ProgGen again\n\n0.9.6.4.4:\n  * Support hscolour, by converting Japanese
  comments into UTF-8\n  * Use optLevel 2 (corresponding to -O2) when compiling the
  query to the server\n  * Remove -O2, -fvia-C, and Flag GHC7 from the .cabal file\n\n0.9.6.4.3:\n
  \ * Fix indentation in the Cabal file, which caused the wrong dependency\n  * Suppress
  warnings\n  * Add package description\n\n0.9.6.4.2:\n  * Support GHC 7.10\n  * Bundle
  the `predicates' files\n\n0.9.6.4.1:\n  * Make buildable with Windows\n\n0.9.6.4:\n

description: ! 'MagicHaskeller is an inductive functional programming system for Haskell.

  This package contains the MagicHaskeller library, which can be used within GHCi
  or as an API for inductive program synthesis.

  It also contains the MagicHaskeller executable that is a standalone synthesis program
  which can be used interactively or as a backend server,

  and the MagicHaskeller.cgi executable that is a CGI frontend for providing the Web
  interface.'

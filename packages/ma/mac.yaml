description: ! 'The MAC library implements /Mandatory Access Control/ concepts in

  Haskell.  It leverages Haskell type-system to restrict how data gets

  propagated within programs and ensures that sensitive data cannot be

  leaked by malicious or buggy code. The library enables untrusted code,

  i.e., code written by someone else, to securely manipulate sensitive

  data while preserving its confidentiality.


  The library provides secure versions of advance programming languages

  features like references, exceptions, and concurrency. This package is

  the accompanying code for the paper

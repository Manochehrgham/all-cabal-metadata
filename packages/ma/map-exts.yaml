description: ! '# map-extensions


  This module contains some extensions to Data.Map. Some of them are convenience functions.


  It also contains functions to support a split-apply-combine workflow, by representing
  labeled, multi-dimensional data as multiply nested `Map`s. For instance, a two dimensional
  matrix with one axis indexed by ''Name''s and the other axis labeled by ''Job''s,
  we would represent such a structure with a Lookup2 Name Job Double. Such a structure
  is not terribly efficient (it takes O(n log(n)) space and O(log(n)) time for insert/update/delete
  operations with high constant factor owing to all the pointer manipulation), but
  it is expressive.


  Here is the rough correspondence between split-apply-combine and the verbs used
  in this package:


  `split`   : `groupBy`


  `apply`   : `fmap`


  `combine` : `foldr/foldMap`


  `reshape` : `transpose`

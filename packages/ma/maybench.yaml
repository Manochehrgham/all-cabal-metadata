description: ! 'Maybench is a tool for comparing the performance

  between two versions of the same program, on a

  series of benchmarks that you design.


  Maybench aims to be easy to use, almost as easy

  as running "time your-program arg1..arg2". Ideally,

  it should be a simple matter for outsiders to write

  timing tests for your programming project and contribute

  them as part of your performance testing suite.


  The Darcs repository is available at <http://code.haskell.org/maybench>.'

description: ! "# Marvin, the paranoid bot (⍺ stage)\n\n[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/JustusAdam/marvin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JustusAdam/marvin)\n[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/marvin.svg)](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/marvin)\n\nMarvin
  is an attempt to combine the ease of use of [hubot](https://hubot.github.com) with
  the typesafety and easy syntax of Haskell and the performance gains from compiled
  languages.\n\nThe in-depth documentation can be found on readthedocs https://marvin.readthedocs.org
  \n\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can get a release version of marvin on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/marvin).\n\nHowever
  this library is still a very early stage so you might want to get updates quicker.
  \nYou can do so by using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org) and adding a recent
  commit of this repository to your `stack.yaml` file.\nStack will take care of downloading
  and building it for you.\n\n\n## TLDR\n\n```Haskell\nmodule MyScript where\n\nimport
  Marvin.Prelude\n\nscript :: IsAdapter a => ScriptInit a\nscript = defineScript \"my-script\"
  $ do\n    hear \"sudo (.+)\" $ do\n        match <- getMatch\n\n        let thing
  = match !! 1\n\n        reply $ \"All right, i'll do \" ++ thing\n    \n    respond
  \"open the (\\\\w+) door\" $ do\n        match <- getMatch\n        let door = match
  !! 1\n        openDoor door\n        send $ printf \"Door %s opened\" door\n    \n
  \   respond \"what is in file (\\\\w+)\\\\??\" $ do\n        match <- getMatch \n
  \       let file = match !! 1\n\n        contents <- liftIO $ readFile file\n\n
  \       send contents\n```\n\n## How to Marvin\n\nThe best way to use Marvin is
  very much taken from hubot.\n\nA Marvin instance composes of a collection of scripts
  which are reactions or actions on certain messages posted in slack.\nEach script
  is a Haskell source file. \nThey get compiled into one single static binary, which
  is a HTTP server that listens for slack's event calls.\n\n### Defining scripts\n\nDefining
  scripts is very easy.\n\nCreate a new Haskell source file like \"MyScript.hs\" and
  import marvins prelude `Marvin.Prelude`.\nThis provides you with all the tools you
  need to interact with marvin.\n\nNow you can start to define your script with `defineScript`
  which produces a script initializer.\nIf you wish to use marvins automatic script
  discovery your script initializer should be named `script`  \n\n```Haskell\nmodule
  MyScript where\n\nimport Marvin.Prelude\n\nscript :: IsAdapter a => ScriptInit a\nscript
  = defineScript \"my-script\" $ do\n    ...\n```\n\nThe script id, \"my-script\"
  in this case, is the name used for this script when repoting loggin messages as
  well as the key for this scripts configuration, see [configuration](#configuration).\n\nIn
  the define script block you can have marvin react to certain events with `hear`
  and `respond`.\nMore information on those in the section [reacting](#reacting)\n\nFinally
  after you have defined your scripts you have to tie them together.\nYou can do this
  [manually](#wiring-manually) or you can have marvin create the boilerplate code
  for you.\n\nTo do this simply place a main file (this is the file you'll be compiling
  later) in the same directory the scripts are placed in.\nLeave the file empty except
  for this line at the top `{-# OPTIONS_GHC -F -pgmF marvin-pp #-}`.\nWhen you compile
  the file marvin will look for any other \".hs\" and \".lhs\" files in the same directory,
  import them and define a server which runs with the `script` from each.\nIf you
  wish to hide a file from the auto discovery either place it in a different directory
  or prefix it with \".\" or \"_\".\n\n### Reacting\n\nThere are two main ways (currently)
  of reacting to events, `hear` and `respond`.\n\n`hear` is for matching any incoming
  message. The provided regex is tried against all incomming messages, if one matches
  the handler is called.\n\n`repond` only triggers on message which have the bot name,
  or a case variation thereof as the first word.\n\n\nOnce a handler has triggered
  it may perform arbitrary IO actions (using `liftIO`) and send messages using `reply`
  and `send`.\n\n- `reply` addresses the message to the original sender of the message
  that triggered the handler.\n- `send` sends it to the same Channel the tiggering
  message weas sent to.\n- `messageChannel` sends a message to a Channel specified
  by the user.\n\n### Configuration\n\nConfiguration for marvin is written in the
  [configurator](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/configurator) syntax.\n\nConfiguration
  pertaining to the bot is stored under the \"bot\" key.\n\n```\nbot {\n    name =
  \"my-bot\"\n    logging = \"INFO\"\n}\n```\n\nBy default each script has access
  to a configuration stored under `script.<script-id>`.\nAnd of course these scripts
  can have nested config groups.\n\n```\nbot {\n    name = \"my-bot\"\n}\n\nscript
  {\n    script-1 {\n        some-string = \"foo\"\n        some-int = 1337\n        bome-bool
  = true\n    }\n    script 2 {\n        nested-group {\n            val = false\n
  \       }\n        name = \"Trump\"\n        capable = false\n    }\n}\n```\n\nConfiguration
  pertaining to the adapter is stored under `adapter.<adapter-name>`\n\n```\nbot {\n
  \   name = \"my-bot\"\n    logging = \"INFO\"\n}\nadapter {\n    slack-rtm {\n        token
  = \"eofk\"\n    }\n}\n``` \n\n### Wiring manually\n\nHow Marvin interacts with your
  chat program depends on the used Adapter.\nFor instance the currently default `slack-rtm`
  adapter creates a (client) websocket connection with the slack API and listens to
  the events there.\nOther adapters may require to set up a server. \n\n### Utilities\n\nAll
  these utilities are already available to you if you import `Marvin.Prelude`.\n\n####
  Regex\n\nImplemented in `Marvin.Util.Regex`, documentation coming soon.\n\n####
  Mutable variables\n\nImplementation started in `Marvin.Util.Mutable`, documentation
  coming soon.\n\n#### Format strings\n\nFor String formatting Marvin re-exposes the
  `Text.Printf` module.  \n\nFormat strings use placeholders with `%`, the default
  formatter (works for all `Show` datatypes) is `%v`.\nSubstitution is done with the
  varargs function `printf`.\nYou can find the full documentation in the documentation
  for the [`Text.Printf`](https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-7.12/base-4.9.0.0/Text-Printf.html#v:printf)
  module.\n\n#### JSON\n\nExposed in `Marvin.Util.JSON` documentation coming soon.
  Until then refer to [aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson).\n\n####
  Logging\n\nMarvin comes with a logging facility built in. \n`Marvin.Util.Logging`
  expose the logging facility. \nSeveral functions are available, depending on the
  urgency of your message, like `errorM`, `infoM` and `criticalM`.\nLogging messages
  made this way are automatically formatted and tagged with the scripts that reported
  them.\n\nBy default all logging messages with higher priority `NOTICE` or higher
  are shown. \nUsing the command line parameter `verbose` also adds `INFO` messages
  and `debug` adds `DEBUG` messages.\nYou can select the exact logging level in your
  config file (see also [configuration](#configuration)).\n \n\n#### Random\n\nImplemented
  in `Marvin.Util.Random`, documentation coming soon.\n\n#### HTTP\n\nCoarsely implemented
  in `Marvin.Util.HTTP`, documentation coming soon.\n"

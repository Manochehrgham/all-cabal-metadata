description: ! 'Haskell''s canonical list of tuples syntax for defining maps is not
  very

  convenient and also has ambiguous semantics.  This package leverages do

  notation to create a lighter syntax that makes semantics explicit and also

  allows the option of fail-fast handling of duplicate keys.'

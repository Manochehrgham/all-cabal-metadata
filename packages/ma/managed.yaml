description: ! 'In Haskell you very often acquire values using the @with...@

  idiom using functions of type @(a -> IO r) -> IO r@.  This idiom forms a

  @Monad@, which is a special case of the @ContT@ monad (from @transformers@) or

  the @Codensity@ monad (from @kan-extensions@).  The main purpose behind this

  package is to provide a restricted form of these monads specialized to this

  unusually common case.


  The reason this package defines a specialized version of these types is to:


  * be more beginner-friendly,


  * simplify inferred types and error messages, and:


  * provide some additional type class instances that would otherwise be orphan

  instances'

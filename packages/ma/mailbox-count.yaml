  mailbox-count [OPTIONS]

  @


  Mailbox-count produces a simple count of mailboxes that exist

  per-domain in some SQL database. The default queries are compatible

  with the schema used by PostfixAdmin <http://postfixadmin.sourceforge.net/>,

  but it is possible to supply your own queries via the @--summary-query@

  and @--detail-query@ options.


  The summary report lists each domain, along with the number of

  mailboxes owned by that domain. The order is determined by the summary

  query, which lists the domains alphabetically by default.


  The default detail report shows the same, but also contains a list of

  each individual mailbox (again in alphabetical order) belonging to the

  domains.


  /Input/:


  None.


  /Output/:


  Either a summary, or detailed report (with @--detail@) of the

  number of mailboxes per-domain contained in the database.


  /Options/:


  @

  \--database

  @


  The name of the database (or file, if SQLite) to which we should

  connect.


  Default: The name of the current user (Postgres only).


  @

  \--detail

  @


  Produce a detailed report listing all mailboxes by domain.


  @

  \--detail-query

  @


  SQL query used to produce the detail report. This should return the

  set of all (domain, username) pairs. See the default value for an

  example.


  Default: \"SELECT domain,username FROM mailbox ORDER BY domain;\"


  @

  \--host

  @


  Hostname where the database is located (Postgres-only).


  Default: None, a UNIX domain socket connection is attempted (Postgres only)


  @

  \--password

  @


  Password used to connect to the database (Postgres-only).


  Default: None (assumes passwordless authentication)


  @

  \--port

  @

  Port number used to connect to the database (Postgres-only).


  Default: None, a UNIX domain socket connection is attempted (Postgres only)


  @

  \--summary-query

  @


  SQL query used to produce the summary report. This should return

  (domain, user count) pairs. See the default value for an

  example.


  Default: \"SELECT domain,COUNT(username) FROM mailbox GROUP BY domain

  ORDER BY domain;\"


  @

  \--username

  @


  Username used to connect to the database (Postgres-only).


  Default: The current user

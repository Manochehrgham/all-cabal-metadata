description: ! 'Matrix library. Basic operations and some algorithms.


  To get the library update your cabal package list (if needed) with @cabal update@
  and

  then use @cabal install matrix@, assuming that you already have Cabal installed.

  Usage examples are included in the API reference generated by Haddock.


  If you want to use GSL, BLAS and LAPACK, @hmatrix@ (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix>)

  is the way to go.'

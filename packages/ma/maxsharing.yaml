description: ! 'Parses a lambda-letrec term; transforms it into a first-order

  term graph representation; minimises the graph by bisimulation

  collapse; reads back a lambda-letrec term which has the same

  unfolding as the original term but is more (maximally) compact.

  If executable "dot" from graphviz is available, the graphs are

  displayed (tested for Linux). The approach is described in an

  ICFP-paper (http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2628136.2628148) and an

  extended version thereof (http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1460).'

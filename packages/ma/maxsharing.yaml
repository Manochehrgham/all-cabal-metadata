description: ! 'Parses a lambda-letrec term; transforms it into a first-order

  term graph representation; minimises the graph; reads back a

  lambda-letrec term which has the same unfolding as the original

  term, but exhibits maximal sharing.

  If executable "dot" from graphviz is available, the graphs are

  displayed (tested for Linux).

  The approach is described in a technical report:

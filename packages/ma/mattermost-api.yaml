synopsis: Client API for MatterMost chat system
changelog: ! "\n30802.1.0\n=========\n\nThis release supports server version 3.8.2.\n\nAPI
  changes:\n* Made the PendingPost `created_at` field optional. It defaults to 0.\n
  \ This behavior is due to MatterMost's support for admins setting the\n  creation
  timestamp to values in the past. A value of zero causes\n  the server to use the
  server's clock to set the creation timestamp.\n  Any other value is only permitted
  for users with administrative\n  privileges.\n* Moved some types to a new Types.Internal
  module and exposed that\n  module for testing purposes. It should not be used by
  anyone wanting\n  a stable API. For a stable API, see the export list for the Types\n
  \ module.\n\n30802.0.0\n=========\n\nThis release supports server version 3.8.2.\n\nAPI
  changes:\n* The `Network.Mattermost.Types` module is now directly exported and all\n
  \ clients should obtain their types from this import. The types are\n  still exported
  from `Network.Mattermost` to allow time for this change\n  but this export is deprecated
  will be removed in a future version.\n* Added the CommandResponse type for the execute
  endpoint.\n* mmGetMoreChannels, mmGetChannelMembers, and mmGetProfiles now take\n
  \ limit/offset parameters.\n* mmGetFile now supports v4 file-fetching.\n* Added
  new constructors to the WebsocketEventType corresponding to\n  server websocket
  events.\n* mmUpdateLastViewedAt was replaced with mmViewChannel.\n* Added the WithDefault
  type to wrap around bools and NotifyOptions.\n* Added NotifyProps types.\n* The
  `Token` type has been replaced with a `Session` type,\n  representing a combination
  of a `Token` and a `ConnectionData`\n  type. All exposed API functions which require
  an authenticated\n  connection will use this instead. This is a major breaking change,\n
  \ but makes the API significantly cleaner.\n* Removed `UserProfile` type in favor
  of single pervasive `User` type.\n* Replaced the return type of `mmGetTeamMembers`
  to use a `TeamMember`\n  instead of raw JSON `Value`s.\n\nDocumentation:\n* All
  API functions how have corresponding HTTP route documentation.\n\nPackage changes:\n*
  Source repository was updated.\n* Constrained 'memory' version to avoid 'foundation'
  dependency.\n* Include Network.Mattermost.TH.\n* The `Network.Mattermost.Websocket`
  module now exports everything\n  exported by `Network.Mattermost.Websocket.Types`
  in order to cut\n  down on the number of imports needed by users.\n\n30701.0.0\n=========\n\n*
  Supports server version 3.7.1.\n\nAPI changes:\n* Tests now provide websocket event
  testing infrastructure\n* The Channel data type now supports Group channels (type
  \"G\")\n* Added mmGetTeamMembers to get the users in a channel\n* Added support
  for the Post type `system_header_change` and the post\n  properties `new_header`
  and `old_header` as described at\n  https://github.com/mattermost/platform/pull/4209\n*
  Removed the UserProfile type in favor of the User type (fixed #23)\n\nBug fixes:\n*
  WebSocket.Types: permit empty `team_id` in event data\n\n30600.2.2\n=========\n\nBug
  fixes:\n * Support optional `notify_props` and `last_password_update` in\n   mmGetUser
  responses.\n\nPackage changes:\n * Renamed ChangeLog.md to CHANGELOG.md.\n\nTesting
  changes:\n * Added support for testing websocket events and updated the test suite\n
  \  to check for expected websocket events.\n\n30600.2.1\n=========\n\nAPI changes:\n
  * Export FileInfo type\n\nBug fixes:\n * Fixed parsing of nullable width/height
  fields in FileInfo\n * Fixed parsing of create_at, update_at, and delete_at timestamp
  fields\n   in FileInfo\n\n30600.2.0\n=========\n\nAPI changes:\n * Added mmDeletePost\n
  * Added mmUpdatePost for editing posts\n * Post: make deletion time optional to
  match server API, do millisecond\n   conversion on JSON encoding\n * PendingPost:
  add fields for setting parents in case of replies\n * Export PendingPost type so
  it can be modified for replies and edits\n\nBug fixes:\n * Post: do millisecond
  conversion of timestamps on JSON encoding\n\n30600.1.0\n=========\n\nAPI changes:\n
  * MinCommand lost its unused minComSuggest field\n\nBug fixes:\n * The JSON format
  of MinCommand got its channelId field (3.5.0) renamed\n   to channel_id (3.6.0).
  See also:\n   https://github.com/mattermost/platform/issues/5281\n\nOther:\n * mmGetJSONBody
  got a debugging label that it now uses to generate\n   exception messages to indicate
  what kind of value it was attempting\n   to parse.\n\n30600.0.0\n=========\n\nInitial
  release for server version 3.6.0.\n\n0.1.0.0\n=======\n\nFirst version.\n"

  Status](https://travis-ci.org/matterhorn-chat/mattermost-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matterhorn-chat/mattermost-api)

  # mattermost-api

  Client side API for communicating with a MatterMost server, in Haskell.


  # Testing


  We use the MaterMost docker image for detecting changes in the API. See

  `.travis.yml` or the [MatterMost

  docs](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/docker-local-machine.html#one-line-docker-install)

  for the details.


  If you are testing your changes locally during development, you will want to run

  the script `./test/local_test_mm.sh`.


  **Note: The `local_test_mm.sh` script will stop and remove a docker container

  named `mattermost-preview`.**


  **Note: The tests can only be run once against a given MatterMost instance. This

  is because the scripts currently assume they can create an initial admin user.**


  **Note: The scripts assume the instance is reachable on `localhost:8065` over plain

  HTTP.**


  For use in production we use TLS, but for testing purposes we avoid the

  certificate setup.


  # Our Versioning Scheme


  This library uses the same versioning scheme as `matterhorn`, see [Our

  Versioning

  Scheme](https://github.com/matterhorn-chat/matterhorn/blob/master/README.md#our-versioning-scheme).

  The short version is that in `ABBCC.X.Y`, the `ABBCC` corresponds to MatterMost

  server version `A.BB.CC` and the `X.Y` portion of the version string corresponds

  to the version of `mattermost-api` package releases.

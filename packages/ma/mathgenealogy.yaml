description: ! 'A command line program for extracting data from the

  Mathematics Genealogy Project (<http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/index.php>).

  Note that this database also contains many entries of computer scientists.


  Lookup your entry at <http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/index.php> and

  then use that URL as a command line argument.

  For example, if Carl Gauss wanted to explore his academic ancestors, he

  would type


  > mathgenealogy http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18231


  which produces the directed acyclic graph

  <http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22490968/genealogy_of_gauss.svg>. See


  > mathgenealogy --help


  for the complete list of options. Requires the /dot/ program, which is

  part of the GraphViz package (/version 2.28.0 or later!/) to run.


  Feedback and bug reports are appreciated!


  /Changes in 1.3.0:/


  * Switched to HTML-like labels in GraphViz. This is required for the advanced

  font formatting options. ATTENTION: this needs a recent

  installation of GraphViz (Linux: 2.28.0; MacOS: 2.29) and will yield

  best results for SVG output files. If you have an older version of GraphViz

  or run into issues, try the ''--oldtextlabels'' option.


  * Downloaded entries are stored locally. This avoids re-downloading the same

  data if you want to generate multiple graphs of the same entry with

  different formatting options.


  * Added more options for fine-tuning the fonts and colors. (requested by users)


  * Default output is now SVG, as this is the format best supported by GraphViz.


  /Changes in 1.2.0:/


  * Fixed handling of entries that have multiple degrees. (reported by Dima Pasechnik)


  /Changes in 1.1.1:/


  * Provide error message when given invalid start URL


  * Documentation and code cleanup


  /Changes in 1.0.0:/


  * Choice between PDF and PNG output


  * Optional inclusion of PhD theses in output


  /Changes in 0.0.2:/


  * Fixed handling of trailing commas (reported by Alexander Koessler)'

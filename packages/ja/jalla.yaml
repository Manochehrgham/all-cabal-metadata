description: ! 'NOTE: Hackage does not know LAPACKE, therefore jalla and the documentation

  are not built there. You can find its documentation at

  <http://www.goschs.de/jalla>.


  Jalla aims at providing high level functions for linear algebra computations which

  should be fast and easy enough to use. Under the hood, BLAS and LAPACKE are used

  (LAPACKE is a standard C interface to LAPACK which is part of LAPACK since version
  3.4).


  The modules Numeric.Jalla.Matrix and Numeric.Jalla.Vector are probably

  the most useful ones for users. Everything under Numeric.Jalla.Foreign

  is basically wrapping stuff.


  Currently, I am adding new functions whenever I find some time. Please help, if
  you want to!

  There are not many tests yet, and we need some nicer error reporting (nicer than
  exceptions).'

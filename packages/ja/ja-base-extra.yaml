description: ! '# ja-base-extra


  Or **j**ustus-**a**dam-base-extra. That''s the expanded form.


  This is a library of small helper functions that I use and that depend only on the
  `base` library. But of which I am certain they would never be added to the actual
  `base` library.



  ## Usage


  Just add as dependency and done. (I''ll push it to hackage soon™)


  ## Naming


  This library is named after me for two reasons:


  1. because it is an opinionated library of things that I thought were necessary
  and

  2. because naming it and the included modules something generic is not cool, if
  it is not generic by design (like the `extra` library)


  ## Documentation


  Haddock docks coming soon™

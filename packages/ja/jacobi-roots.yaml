description: ! 'This package provides roots of shifted Radau and Legendre polynomials
  to double precision.


  The roots are precomputed using a Mathematica script, and degrees of up to a few
  hundred are provided.


  See the "JacobiRoots" module for documentation


  To build this from scratch, first run @compute_roots.nb@ in Mathematica to generate
  @gen\/JacobiRootsRaw300.hs@. Then type @make@ to run @gen\/Convert.hs@, which creates
  @src\/JacobiRootsBinary.hs@. Then the normal @cabal configure; cabal build@'

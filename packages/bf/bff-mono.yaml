description: ! 'This package provides a way to make a bidirectional

  transformation (a getter/setter pair, or so-called lens)

  from a description of unidirectional transformation.

  Like ''bff'' package, the package constructs bidirectional

  transformations based on the free theorem.

  Unlike ''bff'' package,

  the package supports some of monomorphic transformations.'
